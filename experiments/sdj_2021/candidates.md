# Spiel des Jahres


## #1: {{% game 318977 %}}MicroMacro: Crime City{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 15–45 minutes, 10+ years, light (1.1), 99% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="318977" size="x300" alt="MicroMacro: Crime City" >}}

Some games can be played without reading any rules. {{% game 318977 %}}MicroMacro{{% /game %}} goes one step further: You can start playing the game right on the box. This alone makes it a strong contender. I wonder though if the jury will consider a game full of murders and crimes a pleasant pastime for families.


## #2: {{% game 266524 %}}PARKS{{% /game %}}

*1–5 players, 30–60 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 88% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="266524" size="x300" alt="PARKS" >}}

Something of a latecomer to Germany, the looks and theme of {{% game 266524 %}}PARKS{{% /game %}} are somewhat reminiscent of the previous {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} winner {{% game 266192 %}}Wingspan{{% /game %}}. Will this work to its advantage?


## #3: {{% game 276498 %}}Paris: La Cité de la Lumière{{% /game %}}

*2 players, 30 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (2.1), 96% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="276498" size="x300" alt="Paris: La Cité de la Lumière" >}}

While the algorithm ranks this highly, I still do not see a pure 2-player-game win the main award. A place on the recommendation list on the other hand is always possible.


## #4: {{% game 256788 %}}Detective Club{{% /game %}}

*4–8 players, 45 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.2), 100% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="256788" size="x300" alt="Detective Club" >}}

Light and social, just like the jury likes their {{% sdj %}}red games{{% /sdj %}}. {{% game 256788 %}}Detective Club{{% /game %}} requires at least four players though, and the jury generally wants three players as well.


## #5: {{% game 223040 %}}Fantasy Realms{{% /game %}}

*3–6 players, 20 minutes, 14+ years, medium light (1.7), 100% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="223040" size="x300" alt="Fantasy Realms" >}}

Quite an old game by international standards, but it garnered its share of positive review. A breezy card game might just be what the jury is looking for!


## #6: {{% game 300327 %}}The Castles of Tuscany{{% /game %}}

*2–4 players, 45–60 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 89% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="300327" size="x300" alt="The Castles of Tuscany" >}}

There's no doubt that the jury is a fan of [Stefan Feld](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=4958)'s work. {{% game 300327 %}}The Castles of Tuscany{{% /game %}} could earn him his first {{% sdj / %}} nomination.


## #7: {{% game 274960 %}}Point Salad{{% /game %}}

*2–6 players, 15–30 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.2), 100% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="274960" size="x300" alt="Point Salad" >}}

By all accounts, this seems to be a light and fun card game that could well be in the jury's wheelhouse. I love the self-ironic title, but will the average gamer get the joke?


## #8: {{% game 283864 %}}Trails of Tucana{{% /game %}}

*1–8 players, 15 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.3), 100% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="283864" size="x300" alt="Trails of Tucana" >}}

Yet another simple roll/flip'n'write. It reminds me a lot of last year's {{% game 270673 %}}Silver & Gold{{% /game %}} which I had high hopes for, but was completely ignored by the jury. Might not be the best omen for {{% game 283864 %}}Trails of Tucana{{% /game %}}.


## #9: {{% game 299172 %}}The Key: Murder at the Oakdale Club{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 15–20 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (2.0), 99% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="299172" size="x300" alt="The Key: Murder at the Oakdale Club" >}}

One year after his smash hit {{% game 284083 %}}The Crew{{% /game %}}, [Thomas Sing](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=45563) might reach for {{% sdj / %}} this time. A real-time deduction game sure sounds like a winning combo!


## #10: {{% game 300877 %}}New York Zoo{{% /game %}}

*1–5 players, 30–60 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.0), 96% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="300877" size="x300" alt="New York Zoo" >}}

Another puzzle game by [Uwe Rosenberg](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=10), this time filled to the brim with cute animals. Who could resist this proposition?


## #11: {{% game 326494 %}}The Adventures of Robin Hood{{% /game %}}

*2–4 players, 60 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (1.7), 99% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="326494" size="x300" alt="The Adventures of Robin Hood" >}}

As a very recent release, {{% game 326494 %}}Robin Hood{{% /game %}} doesn't have many ratings yet, so it's hard for the algorithm to pick up. But by all appearances, [Michael Menzel](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=11825) of {{% game 127398 %}}Andor{{% /game %}} fame pulled off another great story game.


## #12: {{% game 274841 %}}Cóatl{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 30–60 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.0), 98% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="274841" size="x300" alt="Cóatl" >}}

{{% game 274841 %}}Cóatl{{% /game %}}


# Kennerspiel des Jahres


## #1: {{% game 281259 %}}The Isle of Cats{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 60–90 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (2.3), 94% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="281259" size="x300" alt="The Isle of Cats" >}}

The Internet loves cats, and, apparently, so does the BGG crowd. Card drafting and tile laying combined with lots of cats – what's there not to like?


## #2: {{% game 283155 %}}Calico{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 30–45 minutes, 13+ years, medium light (2.2), 62% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="283155" size="x300" alt="Calico" >}}

More cats, more puzzling – I sense a theme here. {{% game 283155 %}}Calico{{% /game %}} is held in high regards as well, even for {{% sdj / %}} by some. It'll be exciting to see if the jury has it on their list, and, if so, on which.


## #3: {{% game 312484 %}}Lost Ruins of Arnak{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 30–120 minutes, 12+ years, medium (2.8), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="312484" size="x300" alt="Lost Ruins of Arnak" >}}

This game seems to be on everybody's mind, and even though nobody seems excited by it, the consensus is that {{% game 312484 %}}Lost Ruins of Arnak{{% /game %}} perfectly combines deckbuilding with worker placement.


## #4: {{% game 224517 %}}Brass: Birmingham{{% /game %}}

*2–4 players, 60–120 minutes, 14+ years, medium heavy (3.9), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="224517" size="x300" alt="Brass: Birmingham" >}}

Certainly a fan favourite, it climbed to #3 on BGG before it finally received a German release. It's definitely way too heavy to win {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}, but that wouldn't stop the jury from recommending it.


## #5: {{% game 283294 %}}Yukon Airways{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 60–90 minutes, 14+ years, medium (2.7), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="283294" size="x300" alt="Yukon Airways" >}}

The only thing on my mind about this game: Would the jury really award a game about flying after we've been collectively grounded for over a year?


## #6: {{% game 317311 %}}Switch & Signal{{% /game %}}

*2–4 players, 45 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 83% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="317311" size="x300" alt="Switch & Signal" >}}

Train games have a long tradition in board gaming, but {{% game 317311 %}}Switch & Signal{{% /game %}} is the first one I know of to approach the topic co-operatively. Colour me intrigued.


## #7: {{% game 300531 %}}Paleo{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 45–60 minutes, 10+ years, medium (2.6), 88% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="300531" size="x300" alt="Paleo" >}}

{{% game 300531 %}}Paleo{{% /game %}} already received so much love for the game, and so much criticism for the rule book. The jury is known to exclude games when they just put an undue burden on the players to learn, but in this case the qualities of the game probably win.


## #8: {{% game 281075 %}}Welcome to New Las Vegas{{% /game %}}

*1–50 players, 35 minutes, 10+ years, medium (2.9), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="281075" size="x300" alt="Welcome to New Las Vegas" >}}

The jury ignored the original {{% game 233867 %}}Welcome To…{{% /game %}}, but will it notice this more complex version set in Nevada?


## #9: {{% game 286096 %}}Tapestry{{% /game %}}

*1–5 players, 90–120 minutes, 12+ years, medium (2.9), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="286096" size="x300" alt="Tapestry" >}}

Stonemaier Games sure knows how to put out beautful products, but I think in the case of {{% game 286096 %}}Tapestry{{% /game %}} the result is just too big and too expensive for a {{% kdj / %}}.


## #10: {{% game 282954 %}}Paris{{% /game %}}

*2–4 players, 90 minutes, 12+ years, medium (2.7), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="282954" size="x300" alt="Paris" >}}

The K&K of board gaming show no signs of slowing down, and their latest brain child {{% game 282954 %}}Paris{{% /game %}} has received a lot of love.


## #11: {{% game 304420 %}}Bonfire{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 70–100 minutes, 12+ years, medium heavy (3.6), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="304420" size="x300" alt="Bonfire" >}}

{{% game 304420 %}}Bonfire{{% /game %}}


## #12: {{% game 251247 %}}Barrage{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 60–120 minutes, 14+ years, medium heavy (4.0), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="251247" size="x300" alt="Barrage" >}}

{{% game 251247 %}}Barrage{{% /game %}}
