# Spiel des Jahres


## #1: {{% game 355483 %}}Die wandelnden TÃ¼rme{{% /game %}}

*2â€“6 players, 30 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (2.0), 96% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="355483" size="x300" alt="Die wandelnden TÃ¼rme" >}}

Well, this is something of a surprise prediction since {{% game 355483 %}}Die wandelnden TÃ¼rme{{% /game %}} doesn't even have an English title yet and only a handful of ratings on BGG. There must be something about this game if the algorithm could still pick it up amongst the crowd.


## #2: {{% game 329839 %}}So Clover!{{% /game %}}

*3â€“6 players, 30 minutes, 10+ years, light (1.1), 100% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="329839" size="x300" alt="So Clover!" >}}

A cooperative wordâ€“association game by publisher Repos Production, in many ways reminiscent of {{% sdj / %}} winner {{% game 254640 %}}Just One{{% /game %}}. The jury generally doesn't mind repeating themselves, so {{% game 329839 %}}So Clover!{{% /game %}} is definitely in the running.


## #3: {{% game 300905 %}}Top Ten{{% /game %}}

*4â€“9 players, 30 minutes, 14+ years, light (1.1), 98% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="300905" size="x300" alt="Top Ten" >}}

Another cooperative party game, light and with an immediate hook â€“ exactly what the jury is looking for.


## #4: {{% game 327831 %}}Lost Cities: Roll & Write{{% /game %}}

*2â€“5 players, 30 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.1), 97% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="327831" size="x300" alt="Lost Cities: Roll & Write" >}}

This is an interesting one: While the jury completely ignored the original {{% game 50 %}}Lost Cities{{% /game %}} (now considered a classic), it did pin the main award on {{% game 34585 %}}Keltis{{% /game %}} (essentially the board game version). Will they come back to the same system for the {{% game 327831 %}}Roll & Write{{% /game %}} version?


## #5: {{% game 300753 %}}Cross Clues{{% /game %}}

*2â€“6 players, 5â€“10 minutes, 7+ years, light (1.0), 100% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="300753" size="x300" alt="Cross Clues" >}}

â€¦and another cooperative wordâ€“association party gameâ€¦ I sense a pattern! ðŸ˜… Does {{% game 300753 %}}Cross Clues{{% /game %}} have what it takes to set itself apart from its competitors?


## #6: {{% game 342927 %}}Fire & Stone{{% /game %}}

*2â€“4 players, 45â€“60 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.0), 86% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="342927" size="x300" alt="Fire & Stone" >}}

The latest game by "Mr. {{% game 822 %}}Carcassonne{{% /game %}}", so this fact alone makes {{% game 342927 %}}Fire & Stone{{% /game %}} an interesting game to watch.


## #7: {{% game 330174 %}}Explorers{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 20 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (1.8), 98% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="330174" size="x300" alt="Explorers" >}}

Phil Walker-Harding has built an impressive portfolio of award winning games over the past years, so {{% game 330174 %}}Explorers{{% /game %}} could be his next shot at winning {{% sdj / %}}.


## #8: {{% game 346703 %}}7 Wonders: Architects{{% /game %}}

*2â€“7 players, 25 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.4), 99% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="346703" size="x300" alt="7 Wonders: Architects" >}}

The little sibling of the inaugural {{% kdj / %}} winner already won the 2022 As d'Or, the French equivalent of {{% sdj / %}}, so this is definitely one to watch.


## #9: {{% game 328859 %}}Hula-Hoo!{{% /game %}}

*2â€“6 players, 10â€“20 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (2.0), 95% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="328859" size="x300" alt="Hula-Hoo!" >}}

There's been many cute and/or ugly animal themed light games by Jacques Zeimet that were often well received by the jury, so {{% game 328859 %}}Hula-Hoo!{{% /game %}} could be the next in that line.


## #10: {{% game 338628 %}}TRAILS{{% /game %}}

*2â€“4 players, 20â€“40 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (1.8), 93% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="338628" size="x300" alt="TRAILS" >}}

{{% game 266524 %}}PARKS{{% /game %}} wasn't as well received in Germany as it was internationally, so maybe its successor {{% game 338628 %}}TRAILS{{% /game %}} will fare better.


## #11: {{% game 339484 %}}Savannah Park{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 20â€“40 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (1.7), 95% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="339484" size="x300" alt="Savannah Park" >}}

{{% game 339484 %}}Savannah Park{{% /game %}} by Kramer & Kiesling follows another trend in 2022: animals. Can this one stand out?


## #12: {{% game 330038 %}}Llamaland{{% /game %}}

*2â€“4 players, 45 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.0), 80% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="330038" size="x300" alt="Llamaland" >}}

{{% game 330038 %}}Llamaland{{% /game %}}


# Kennerspiel des Jahres


## #1: {{% game 246784 %}}Cryptid{{% /game %}}

*3â€“5 players, 30â€“50 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 74% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="246784" size="x300" alt="Cryptid" >}}

A bit of a latecomer to Germany, {{% game 246784 %}}Cryptid{{% /game %}} already gathered a lot of momentum internationally and hence is an easy recommendation for our algorithm.


## #2: {{% game 295947 %}}Cascadia{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 30â€“45 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (1.9), 53% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="295947" size="x300" alt="Cascadia" >}}

{{% game 295947 %}}Cascadia{{% /game %}} is another international favourite that was met with positive reviews, though most find it soothing rather than exciting. Also, it seems to be just on the border between the two awards, so could end up on either list.


## #3: {{% game 342942 %}}Ark Nova{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 90â€“150 minutes, 14+ years, medium heavy (3.7), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="342942" size="x300" alt="Ark Nova" >}}

{{% game 342942 %}}Ark Nova{{% /game %}} is *the* heavy eurogame of the season and has a good shot at a spot on the longlist. It's way too heavy for a nomination though.


## #4: {{% game 279537 %}}The Search for Planet X{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 60 minutes, 13+ years, medium light (2.3), 98% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="279537" size="x300" alt="The Search for Planet X" >}}

Just like {{% game 246784 %}}Cryptid{{% /game %}}, {{% game 279537 %}}The Search for Planet X{{% /game %}} is a deduction game that gained a lot of recognition internationally and now could receive its share of fame in Germany.


## #5: {{% game 314491 %}}Meadow{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 60â€“90 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 97% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="314491" size="x300" alt="Meadow" >}}

Another nonâ€“controversial game with a soothing animal theme. I don't have more to say about {{% game 314491 %}}Meadow{{% /game %}}.


## #6: {{% game 316554 %}}Dune: Imperium{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 60â€“120 minutes, 14+ years, medium (3.0), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="316554" size="x300" alt="Dune: Imperium" >}}

My feeling is that games with a strong franchise generally are somewhat outside the jury's scope: While strongly drawing in the enthusiastic fan base, it leaves the majority of the audience rather distance. {{% game 316554 %}}Dune: Imperium{{% /game %}} might just be the exception to the rule since the reviews were really strong.


## #7: {{% game 227224 %}}The Red Cathedral{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 80 minutes, 10+ years, medium (2.8), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="227224" size="x300" alt="The Red Cathedral" >}}

Another game that was available internationally and has recently seen a German release from Kosmos, who certainly know how to win awards with their games.


## #8: {{% game 290236 %}}Canvas{{% /game %}}

*1â€“5 players, 30 minutes, 14+ years, medium light (1.7), 88% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="290236" size="x300" alt="Canvas" >}}

{{% game 290236 %}}Canvas{{% /game %}} definitely has some stunning artwork, though the critical response to the gameplay was rather lacklusterâ€¦


## #9: {{% game 341048 %}}Free Ride{{% /game %}}

*1â€“5 players, 50â€“90 minutes, 10+ years, medium (2.7), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="341048" size="x300" alt="Free Ride" >}}

Friedemann Friese's venture into the train game genre. It's been a while since the jury was really excited by one of his creations.


## #10: {{% game 328479 %}}Living Forest{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 40 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 77% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="328479" size="x300" alt="Living Forest" >}}

{{% game 328479 %}}Living Forest{{% /game %}} is the latest {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} hotness. It got quite recently released and hasn't received a lot of ratings yet, but is definitely on the jury's radar.


## #11: {{% game 318560 %}}Witchstone{{% /game %}}

*2â€“4 players, 60â€“90 minutes, 12+ years, medium (2.7), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="318560" size="x300" alt="Witchstone" >}}

{{% game 318560 %}}Witchstone{{% /game %}}


## #12: {{% game 346501 %}}Mille Fiori{{% /game %}}

*2â€“4 players, 60â€“90 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 92% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="346501" size="x300" alt="Mille Fiori" >}}

{{% game 346501 %}}Mille Fiori{{% /game %}}
