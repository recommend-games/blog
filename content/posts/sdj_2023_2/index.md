[Nominations are out](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/aktuelle-preistraeger-2023/)! The jury selected a total of fifteen games for their longlist, ten for {{% sdj / %}} and five for {{% kdj / %}}. Out of these games, three games each are nominated for the two awards and can hope to get the coveted meeple added to their covers on July 16.

Let's dive straight into the nominations and recommendations, before we discuss how good (or bad) [my predictions]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2023/index.md">}}) were and if the agreed with our [{{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} score]({{<ref "posts/kennerspiel/index.md">}}).


# Nominated for {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2023{{% /sdj %}}

{{< img src="sdj-2023" size="x300" alt="Spiel des Jahres 2023" >}}


## {{% game 370591 %}}Dorfromantik: The Board Game{{% /game %}}

*1â€“6 players, 30â€“60 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (1.7), 100% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="370591" size="x300" alt="Dorfromantik: The Board Game" >}}

Probably the strongest contender for a nomination beforehand. No surprises hereâ€¦


## {{% game 370164 %}}Fun Facts{{% /game %}}

*4â€“8 players, 30 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.0), 100% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="370164" size="x300" alt="Fun Facts" >}}

Together with {{% game 375651 %}}That's Not a Hat{{% /game %}}, designer Kasper Lapp had two entries with quite some buzz, though the algorithm wouldn't pick it up and placed {{% game 370164 %}}Fun Facts{{% /game %}} on #36 of the predictions.


## {{% game 353545 %}}Next Station: London{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 25â€“30 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.4), 100% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="353545" size="x300" alt="Next Station: London" >}}

This was the #1 prediction, so the nomination is a logical consequence, even though I didn't see it being nominated.


## {{% sdj / %}} recommendations

* {{% game 357563 %}}Akropolis{{% /game %}}: Having won the As d'Or and being placed #5 by the algorithm, "just" a recommendation is almost disappointingâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰
* {{% game 318243 %}}HITSTER{{% /game %}}: Only #18 by the algorithm, but I squeezed it in as an honourable mention. This could've been a strong contender for {{% sdj / %}}, but it works best with a paid Spotify subscription, which really hampered its chances for a nomination.
* {{% game 356742 %}}KuZOOkA{{% /game %}}: I've even had this down for a nomination, so a recommendation was expected in the end.
* {{% game 358690 %}}MANTIS{{% /game %}}: This year's obligatory jury suprise, just #173 prediction according to algorithm. Another simple card game by the {{% game 172225 %}}Exploding Kittens{{% /game %}} publishers.
* {{% game 266830 %}}QE{{% /game %}}: For me this was a candidate for a {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} nomination â€“ in the end, the algorithm was right, predicting a place on the longlist for {{% sdj / %}}.
* {{% game 367220 %}}Sea Salt & Paper{{% /game %}}: At #17 of the predictions a near miss. Another fairly simple card game that was on many commentators' lists.
* {{% game 375651 %}}That's Not a Hat{{% /game %}}: As mentioned with {{% game 370164 %}}Fun Facts{{% /game %}}, this was another much discussed game. At #20, the algorithm actually gave it the better odds.


# Nominated for {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2023{{% /kdj %}}

{{< img src="ksdj-2023" size="x300" alt="Kennerspiel des Jahres 2023" >}}


## {{% game 359970 %}}Challengers!{{% /game %}}

*1â€“8 players, 45 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (1.8), 0% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="359970" size="x300" alt="Challengers!" >}}

{{% game 359970 %}}Challengers!{{% /game %}} was definitely one of the jury members' darling and couldn't possibly be absent from any predictions list. The algorithm put it on #16, I saw it amongst the nominations â€“ for {{% sdj / %}}â€¦ We'll have more things to discuss on this topic in the follow-up predictions article.


## {{% game 177478 %}}IKI{{% /game %}}

*2â€“4 players, 60â€“90 minutes, 14+ years, medium (3.0), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="177478" size="x300" alt="IKI" >}}

Even though the algorithm placed it #2 amongst the predictions, this game feels a bit like an underdog, partially because it was originally released in 2015, but didn't receive much attention until its got a second edition. Now it's nominated for the most prestigious award in board gaming!


## {{% game 258779 %}}Planet Unknown{{% /game %}}

*1â€“6 players, 60â€“80 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 7% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="258779" size="x300" alt="Planet Unknown" >}}

The only {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} nomination I got dead-on right, even though the algorithm placed it only on #21 â€“ again for the wrong awardâ€¦


## {{% kdj / %}} recommendations

* {{% game 368954 %}}Council of Shadows{{% /game %}}: TODO
* {{% game 345584 %}}Mindbug: First Contact{{% /game %}}: TODO


# How good were the predictions?

This really is a drama in three acts: the decision of {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} or not, the algorithm picking the longlist, and finally my guts picking the shortlist.
