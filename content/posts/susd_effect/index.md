* Introduce SU&SD

* Can we attribute the increase to the video?
  * After all, it was pre-Xmas time, maybe people were just buying more games
* Enter Synthetic Control
* Explain briefly what it is and how it works
* Link to articles
* Synthetic Control with convex combination
* Print the weights
* Plot the results, both absolute and relative
* Is it significant? Fisher's exact test
