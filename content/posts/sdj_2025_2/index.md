[Nominations are out](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/aktuelle-preistraeger-2025/)! The jury selected a total of sixteen games for their longlist, nine for {{% sdj / %}} and seven for {{% kdj / %}}. Out of these games, three games each are nominated for the two awards and can hope to get the coveted meeple added to their covers on July 13.

Let's dive straight into the nominations and recommendations, before we discuss how good (or bad) [my predictions]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2025/index.md">}}) were and if the agreed with our [{{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} score]({{<ref "posts/kennerspiel/index.md">}}).


# Nominated for {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2025{{% /sdj %}}

{{< img src="sdj-2025" size="x300" alt="Spiel des Jahres 2025" >}}


## {{% game 413246 %}}Bomb Busters{{% /game %}}

*2â€“5 players, 30 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.0), 54% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}, prediction #1*

{{< img src="413246" size="x300" alt="Bomb Busters" >}}

*Players defuse bombs by deducing and cutting unseen wires of different values.*

{{% game 413246 %}}Bomb Busters{{% /game %}} was probably the top favourite pretty much on everybody's list, and the jury agreed. It did not agree with the algorithm's prediction that this is a {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} (more on that below).


## {{% game 420087 %}}Flip 7{{% /game %}}

*3â€“99 players, 20 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.1), 99% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}, prediction #21*

{{< img src="420087" size="x300" alt="Flip 7" >}}

*Score the cards in front of you, or take another card, risking everything you hold?*

By their own claim "the greatest card game of all time", by some other folks' opinions dull and random.


## {{% game 419639 %}}Krakel Orakel{{% /game %}}

*2â€“8 players, 30 minutes, 10+ years, light (1.1), 100% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}, prediction #7*

{{< img src="419639" size="x300" alt="Krakel Orakel" >}}

*Can you spot and reveal pictures in a tangle of lines?*

Reportedly a drawing game which is still fun for people who cannot draw. With {{% game 252526 %}}Pictomania{{% /game %}}, there's some strong competition in that genre.


## {{% sdj / %}} recommendations

* {{% game 422732 %}}Agent Avenue{{% /game %}} (prediction #8)
* {{% game 416851 %}}Castle Combo{{% /game %}} (#4)
* {{% game 402676 %}}Cities{{% /game %}} (#29)
* {{% game 359318 %}}Foxy{{% /game %}} (no prediction): The inevitable "game that got away" and wasn't on my prediction list at all.
* {{% game 393352 %}}Perfect Words{{% /game %}} (#43)
* {{% game 359124 %}}The Animals of Baker Street{{% /game %}} (#19): One of those late arrivals which is probably already forgotten internationally. I think it's quite charming and I'm happy it got some recongition by the jury.


# Nominated for {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2025{{% /kdj %}}

{{< img src="ksdj-2025" size="x300" alt="Kennerspiel des Jahres 2025" >}}


## {{% game 367966 %}}Endeavor: Deep Sea{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 60â€“120 minutes, 10+ years, medium (2.9), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}, #8*

{{< img src="367966" size="x300" alt="Endeavor: Deep Sea" >}}

*Lead your research institute to explore ocean depths and publish your findings!*

Interestingly, this is a re-re-implementation of {{% game 33160 %}}Endeavor{{% /game %}}, which was recommended back in 2010. The jury has a bit of an inconsistent attitude towards remakes.


## {{% game 385761 %}}Faraway{{% /game %}}

*2â€“6 players, 15â€“30 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (1.9), 67% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}, #3*

{{< img src="385761" size="x300" alt="Faraway" >}}

*Explore a mysterious land and fulfill quests on your way back.*

The nomination that allows you to tick off the "that's supposed to be a {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}?" on your [bingo card](https://lidude.net/sdj-comment-bingo/).


## {{% game 410991 %}}Looot{{% /game %}}

*2â€“4 players, 35 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.1), 92% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}, #30*

{{< img src="410991" size="x300" alt="Looot" >}}

*Gather resources and capture buildings to develop your fjord.*

Not going to lie: {{% game 410991 %}}Looot{{% /game %}}'s description sounds like the most generic Eurogame imaginable.


## {{% kdj / %}} recommendations

* {{% game 411567 %}}The Gang{{% /game %}} (#1 {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} prediction): I hadn't played this one when I made my predictions, but did so in the meantime, and really had a blast. It also made me realise that the algorithm probably got its {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} score wrong, and had to [post](https://bsky.app/profile/markus.recommend.games/post/3lplshtwqus23) about it lest my insights go without receiptsâ€¦ ðŸ¤“ðŸ˜‰
* {{% game 381188 %}}Kauri{{% /game %}} (#45)
* {{% game 419293 %}}Medical Mysteries: Miami Flatline{{% /game %}} (#27)
* {{% game 424219 %}}Zenith{{% /game %}} (#99)


# How good were the predictions?

This really is a drama in three acts: the decision of {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} or not, the algorithm picking the longlist, and finally my guts picking the shortlist.


## {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} score

The algorithm classified thirteen out of sixteen games on the longlists correctly ({{% game 359318 %}}Foxy{{% /game %}} was completely absent from the predictions, but its Kennerspiel score in the database is 1%), with {{% game 413246 %}}Bomb Busters{{% /game %}} actually on the {{% sdj %}}red{{% /sdj %}} list (as predicted in the last article), and {{% game 410991 %}}Looot{{% /game %}} and {{% game 411567 %}}The Gang{{% /game %}} on the {{% kdj %}}anthracite{{% /kdj %}} list (as predicted on [social media](https://bsky.app/profile/markus.recommend.games/post/3lplshtwqus23)). 81% accurate isn't bad for a simple model classifying a vague concept.


## Longlist

This was a pretty poor year for the algorithm (again). It caught correctly three out of nine games on the {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} longlist (plus one from the other list) and two out of seven on the {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} longlist (again plus one from the other list). Just 31% accurate is really bad, and even 44% accurate when counting the games from the wrong lists isn't great. I thought the changes to the algorithm were working great, but clearly there's still a lot of room for improvement.

I actually thought this year, I'll also calculate some "proper" performance metric, which is one of the standard tool to evaluate how good a given ranking is: the [Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain#Normalized_DCG) (nDCG). I won't get into the details here, but the general idea is to rank item (as we did with our predictions), then score them according to their relevance (in this case we give all games on the longlists a relevance of 1, with all other games getting 0). The higher our ranking sorts the recommended games, the higher the nDCG, and the better we consider the ranking. So, here are the results of the past years:

* 2021: 0.655
* 2022: 0.795
* 2023: 0.669
* 2024: 0.803
* 2025: 0.718

So, in that respect this year was a pretty average year for the predictions. It got somewhat redeemed by the misses being overall still pretty high on the [full prediction lists](predictions.csv).


## Shortlist

Again, a poor performance: I've only predicted two out of six nominations correctly (one on the wrong list), matching the (bottom) performance from last year. Have I lost my edge? Well, I know it won't stop me from coming back next year with more predictions.

That's it for now, we'll be back soon with a little more in-depth analyses on the six nominees and their chances of winning an award.
