The cat's out of the bag and the winners [have been announced](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/the-spiel-des-jahres-2025-is-bomb-busters/)!

After [two]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2023_4/index.md">}}) [year]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2024_4/index.md">}}) of complaining how the ceremonies went on for too long, it appears the jury finally listened to me and made it snappier, while still retaining the sections highlighting all the various facets of the hobby. Kudos! I don't know if the presenters gained more experience in hosting the show, or if their non-polished charm is simply growing on me, but I definitely found the whole thing more enjoyable. (Don't forget the *Empfehlungsliste* really had me cracking upâ€¦)

Enough about the show though, let's look at the actual stars of the evening! ðŸ¤©


# {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2025{{% /sdj %}}

{{< img src="sdj-2025" size="x300" alt="Spiel des Jahres 2025" >}}


## {{% game 413246 %}}Bomb Busters{{% /game %}}

*2â€“5 players, 30 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.0)*

{{< img src="413246" size="x300" alt="Bomb Busters" >}}

*Players defuse bombs by deducing and cutting unseen wires of different values.*

I think it's fair to say that {{% game 413246 %}}Bomb Busters{{% /game %}} has been everybody's favourite for a ling time, and in the end the jury followed the crowd's wisdom. I'm just happy I didn't have to fall out of love with the jury for picking {{% game 420087 %}}Flip 7{{% /game %}}, a game whose appeal I'm yet to find. Instead, we can indeed celebrate the first win for a Japanese, or indeed any Asian, designer, a truly remarkable testimony of the ongoing internationalisation of the hobby.

Finally, it's worth noticing that before 2019, there were only two co-operative {{% sdj / %}} winners: {{% game 2511 %}}Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective{{% /game %}} (1985) and {{% game 98778 %}}Hanabi{{% /game %}} (2013). But since then five out of seven winners were co-operative: {{% game 254640 %}}Just One{{% /game %}} (2019), {{% game 318977 %}}MicroMacro{{% /game %}} (2021), {{% game 370591 %}}Dorfromantik{{% /game %}} (2023), {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} (2024) and {{% game 413246 %}}Bomb Busters{{% /game %}} this year. Let's see if this trend continues in the next years â€“ I'd be all for it. ðŸ¥°


# {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2025{{% /kdj %}}

{{< img src="ksdj-2025" size="x300" alt="Kennerspiel des Jahres 2025" >}}


## {{% game 367966 %}}Endeavor: Deep Sea{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 60â€“120 minutes, 10+ years, medium (2.9)*

{{< img src="367966" size="x300" alt="Endeavor: Deep Sea" >}}

*Lead your research institute to explore ocean depths and publish your findings!*

I clearly should've trusted my own courage and picked {{% game 367966 %}}Endeavor{{% /game %}} as my prediction for {{% kdj / %}}, but I got deterred by the jury's own remarks that this game is on the heavy side of what they'd consider a {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}. (Incidentally, we've been spared the discussion that would have followed if {{% game 385761 %}}Faraway{{% /game %}} had won and hence the {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} would've had a lower complexity rating than the {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} winner.) Despite this ruining my statistics (which are probably statistically indistinguishable from randomly guessing by now), I'm still very happy about the jury's selection since I've already expressed how meh I was on the other two nominees.

An interesting fact about this winner is that to my knowledge it's only the second time a re-implementation won one of the two "adult" awards, the first one being {{% game 6249 %}}Alhambra{{% /game %}} in 2003. (By my count there's three {{% kindersdj / %}} winners which re-implemented a grown up game, with plenty more of those having been nominated.)


# Conclusion

While I don't make predictions for the {{% kindersdj / %}} (simply because I have zero expertise), there's two things I'd like to mention here: First, my daughters watched the live stream with me and asked with every kids' game flashing on the screen what's the age limit and if they can play it (I think I'll solicit their advice next year to pick the winner from the nominees). Second, by winning {{% kindersdj / %}} with {{% game 423232 %}}Topp die Torte!{{% /game %}}, Wolfgang Warsch became the eighth designer to win two out the three different awards (tenth if you include the predecessor *Sonderpreis* winners). He already announced he's going to put his focus on being the first to complete the hat-trick now!

I'll leave you with the remark that this was the second year in a row where both winners are on the high end of complexity for their respective awards. The jury keeps emphasising, and I hope the 'geek crowd will finally accept, that really all eligible games are considered for {{% sdj / %}} and the jury picks in the end the games which resonated best with the target audience. This could be a party game, a simple card game or a challenging deduction game. By and large, the hobby is alive and well, and the sixteen games on the longlist reflect its wide variety.

As always, I'm already excited what the next year of games have in store for us. ðŸ¤“
