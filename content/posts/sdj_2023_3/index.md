The waiting is finally coming to an end! On Sunday, July 16, the jury will announce the winners of {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres{{% /sdj %}} and {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2023{{% /kdj %}}. We're blessed with another year of very strong games and I'm certainly very excited to learn what games will win the two awards.

<!-- TODO Is this really a strong year? ðŸ™ƒ -->

After [two]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020_3/index.md">}}) [years]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2021_3/index.md">}}) of calling both winners correctly, I've missed the {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2022{{% /sdj %}} winner {{% game 295947 %}}Cascadia{{% /game %}} [last year]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2022_3/index.md">}}), so I hope I'll do better this year. ðŸ˜Ž


# Nominated for {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2023{{% /sdj %}}

Before we dive into the individual games, let's look at some numbers to see some objective measures for them â€“ as far as this is possible. What we've got at our disposal are the [recommendations to the `S_d_J` bot](https://recommend.games/#/?for=S_d_J&yearMin=2023&yearMax=2022&include=177478,258779,353545,359970,370164,370591&excludeRated=false), BoardGameGeek's average rating and the [Bayesian rating]({{<ref "posts/reverse_engineer_bgg/index.md">}}). Additionally, I've created a [poll on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3112389/poll-spiel-des-jahres-2023-kennerspiel-des-jahres) where the geeks could have their say:

| Game | [R.G](https://recommend.games/#/?for=S_d_J&yearMin=2023&yearMax=2021&include=353545,370164,370591&excludeRated=false) | Average | Bayes | [Poll](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3112389/poll-spiel-des-jahres-2023-kennerspiel-des-jahres) |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| {{% game 370591 %}}Dorfromantik{{% /game %}} | 7.0 | **7.8** | 6.5 | **69.6%** |
| {{% game 370164 %}}Fun Facts{{% /game %}} | 6.2 | 7.0 | 6.0 | 13.0% |
| {{% game 353545 %}}Next Station{{% /game %}} | **7.5** | 7.5 | **6.5** | 17.4% |

This looks like a head-to-head between {{% game 370591 %}}Dorfromantik{{% /game %}} and {{% game 353545 %}}Next Station: London{{% /game %}}. Or could this be an underdog win for {{% game 370164 %}}Fun Facts{{% /game %}}? Let's take a closer look at the nominees.


## {{% game 370591 %}}Dorfromantik: The Board Game{{% /game %}}

*1â€“6 players, 30â€“60 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (1.7)*

{{< img src="370591" size="x300" alt="Dorfromantik: The Board Game" >}}

There's a lot of buzz going on around this video game adaptation that the jury describes as a "feel-good-game". It sure feels soothing how the landscape evolves over the course of the game, while presenting an interesting challenge to score as many points as possible. The campaign mode with its unlockable content offers some fresh challenges every time and provides a great excuse to come back to the game again and again.

I definitely had a lovely time playing through the campaign for eleven straight evenings. I even found myself looking forward to incorporating that new tile I just unlocked into my strategy for the next game and chase a new highscore. Sure, for the last game or two it did feel like I was mostly going through the motions just to tick off the last boxes, but on the other hand: what was the last game you played for eleven days in a row?

But hidden in there is also my biggest concern: for me, {{% game 370591 %}}Dorfromantik{{% /game %}} is essentially a solo game. Of course, you can discuss with your group where to place a tile, but that's true for *any* solo game â€“ by that logic, they're all just "co-operative games you can play on your own".


## {{% game 370164 %}}Fun Facts{{% /game %}}

*4â€“8 players, 30 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.0)*

{{< img src="370164" size="x300" alt="Fun Facts" >}}

The pitch of a party game that allows you to get to know your group, but in a controlled and gentle manner, seems to be a perfect match for a {{% sdj / %}}. Of course, there isn't "enough game" to it for the 'geek crowd, so don't be fooled by the numbers above. The jury definitely has a fondness for very direct games that mostly play above the table: in the interactions between the players.

Still, I was a little surprised by the nomination. Whilst the reviews were by and large very positive, the game seems to work best with players you already somewhat know. In a fairly random group, the game can fall flat since you have no reference points to go on about when comparing one player's answer to another one's. A {{% sdj / %}} should work for anybody, so that caveat seems significant to me and puts {{% game 370164 %}}Fun Facts{{% /game %}} at quite a disadvantage in the competition for the red meeple.


## {{% game 353545 %}}Next Station: London{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 25â€“30 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.4)*

{{< img src="353545" size="x300" alt="Next Station: London" >}}

By my count, this is the forth "random'n'write" game to be nominated for either award over the past decade, and to be honest, I'm not sure what this particular variant adds to the genre. I do find it very elegant how the fact that every players draws a different underground line every round breaks the symmetry such that everybody's tube map will look different despite following the same cards. But as far as the actual game play goes, I found the very similar {{% game 346482 %}}Voll Verplant{{% /game %}} to be the more intriguing puzzle. My final grump is that a winning map looks nothing like an actual underground map: the scoring incentivises players to zig-zag through quarters and back and forth across the river, and that's just not how an efficient public transport is designed.

This is not to say {{% game 353545 %}}Next Station: London{{% /game %}} wouldn't be a fine game and a deserving nominee, but I'd be fairly disappointed if it did win the award that puts it in line with such giants as {{% game 13 %}}CATAN{{% /game %}} and {{% game 822 %}}Carcassonne{{% /game %}}.

OK, one more complaint, then I'll shut up: I had a hard time learning the game from the rule book, and I've played over 600 games. How would this fair with the average gamer?

Also, there's zero interaction between players. (Yeah, I lied, I wasn't done.) Like, not even a race for completing an objective first or anything. Why would the jury shout from the roof that games are a cultural good worth promoting and then put the spotlight on a game that has players silently ignore each other for half an hour whilst drawing terrible tube maps?

Again, not a bad game by any stretch, I just don't see it as {{% sdj / %}} material.


## Who will win?

Alright, I guess it doesn't come as a surprise that I don't think {{% game 353545 %}}Next Station: London{{% /game %}} will win (or at least I hope it won't). As I already said, {{% game 370164 %}}Fun Facts{{% /game %}} is in some respects the perfect {{% sdj / %}}, still my money is on {{% game 370591 %}}Dorfromantik{{% /game %}}. It has a couple of things going for itself:

1. The jury clearly disagrees with my assessment of it being a solo (only) game, so that doesn't seem to be an obstacle.
2. Bring video gamers into board gaming.
3. Something else?
4. Some similarity to {{% game 295947 %}}Cascadia{{% /game %}}, pro or con?

Let's take a look at the same metrics as above, but for the {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} nominees:

| Game | [R.G](https://recommend.games/#/?for=S_d_J&yearMin=2023&yearMax=2022&include=177478,258779,359970&excludeRated=false) | Average | Bayes | [Poll](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3112389/poll-spiel-des-jahres-2023-kennerspiel-des-jahres) |

| {{% game 258779 %}}Planet Unknown{{% /game %}} | **6.7** | **8.0** | **7.2** | **55.3%** |

The numbers clearly favour {{% game 258779 %}}Planet Unknown{{% /game %}} to win {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2023{{% /kdj %}}. Will the jury agree with the wisdom of the crowd?
