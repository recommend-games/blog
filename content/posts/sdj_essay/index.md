# Introduction

Some of you might have notices that I'm a bit of a {{% sdj / %}} fanboy. üôÉ Every year when the award season rolls around, the discussion about the purpose and the influence of {{% sdj / %}} comes up again. So I thought it's a good idea to collect my thoughts on the subject in one handy place I can easily reference in the future. ü§ì


# What's the purpose of {{% sdj / %}}?

Let's get something fundamental out of the way: what is the purpose of not just this award, but *any* award? Here's the definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Award):

> An award, sometimes called a distinction, is given to a recipient as a token of recognition of excellence in a certain field.

Maybe more important for our discussion isn't what the award is for, but *whom* it is for. Broadly speaking, there's two categories here: *inward* facing awards and *outward* facing awards.

Inward facing awards are given by a certain community (or a subset of it) to its members. The main goal is to bring the community together, recognise current achievements and discuss future directions. Most academic and industry awards fall into this category, as well as popularity contests in board gaming such as the [Deutscher Spielepreis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Spiele_Preis) and the [Golden Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/award/8314/golden-geek-awards). In the most reductive way, it's about the community patting itself on the back.

Outward facing awards, on the other hand, are meant to highlight said "excellence in a certain field" to a wider audience. Those awards are less concerned about being cutting edge or seeking consensus within a community, but rather about promoting the field to the public. {{% sdj / %}} is firmly in this category. To quote [their FAQ](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/faq/):

> Ultimately, the jury is concerned with selecting and rewarding those games that seem best suited to promote the cultural asset of board games in society.

*Kulturgut Spiel* or *games as a cultural asset* is a term you'll hear a lot when you listen to the jury. That's the most philosophical way to state their mission. The most reductive way to view {{% sdj / %}} is as a buyer's guide for people who are looking for one new game a year to play underneath the Christmas tree with their family. üéÑ

I think internalising this mission goes a long way towards understanding what this award does and doesn't want to be.


# Who are the jury members?

Another crucial aspect to understand about {{% sdj / %}} is the jury: who are they, who appoints them and who gives them the right to hand out this award? The short answer to the last question is: nobody. The jury decides who their members should be and what the purpose of the awards should be. There's no supervisory board, no government agency, no industry association that has any say in the matter. The {{% sdj / %}} was founded by a group of journalists and game critics in 1978 who thought it would be useful to have an award that highlights great games to the public. Over the decades, the public has learnt to trust the jury's recommendations, and this trust really is the only currency the jury possesses. That's why they are very protective of their brand and will be very careful about any changed they might implement.

Currently, there's a dozen [jury members](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/the-jury/) voting for {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} and {{% kdj / %}}. All of them review board games regularly, be it for print media such as news papers or special interest magazines like Spielbox, on YouTube or on podcasts. I'll concede that not every jury members writes the sharpest analyses of board games or our industry and I don't know if they would qualify for a PhD in ludology either. But what's more important: they play a lot and they play *with a lot of different people*. That's another fact that's often overlooked in the geek community: the jury members make a very active effort to reach the target audience, i.e., people outside the hardcore hobbyist crowd. What the geeks consider an easy gateway game might well be a considerable challenge for a person who doesn't have the same game literacy and tries to work out the rules from the rulebook in the dim light of the Christmas tree after the third glass of Gl√ºhwein. üç∑

A very valid criticism of the jury is it's a very small group of people ‚Äì not a very diverse one, for that matter, but to their credit they've clearly made an effort to include more women and younger jury members (still all white though). Partially, this is down to the job requirements: there simply aren't all that many people who are able and prepared to systematically play hundreds of games with dozens of people to collate their feedback. But that last point should ease the concern about the jury's size: they might be only twelve individuals, but through their various play groups they represent the taste and opinions of hundreds of people.

One last thing to emphasise about the jury: they all do this as an unpaid side gig. An important part of the jury's self-image is their independence, which necessitates that they don't take money from the industry or any other institution. So, when people "demand" the jury should be doing this and be better at that: remember that they're only humans with families and day jobs who do this in their precious spare time.


# The good old days‚Ä¶

You'll frequently hear the complaints that {{% sdj / %}} has become too shallow, in particular since the introduction of the {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} in 2011 ‚Äì an award which in turn has become too simple in many gamers' eyes. Just quickly to that point: the jury made up the term *Kennerspiel*, so they kind of get to decide what it means. It's often translated as *connoisseur game*, but that doesn't really capture its meaning. The name comes from *kennen*, i.e., it's an award for people who already *know* some games, no more, no less. As mentioned, the jury plays with a wide variety of people and they really experience when a game is hard to approach for some people, so we should really take their word for it what they label {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}. (And it's not like they are inconsistent about it ‚Äì there clearly are [some patterns]({{<ref "posts/kennerspiel/index.md">}}) to it. ü§ì)

But let's go back to those "good old days" in the second half of the 90s. {{% game 13 %}}CATAN{{% /game %}} won {{% sdj / %}} in 1995 ‚Äì at that time, this was considered a really heavy pick (though the jury chairman [Harald Schrapers](https://x.com/HaraldSchrapers/status/1287829667211284480) would still consider it for {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}, not {{% kdj / %}}). Seemingly, this opened a door and paved the way for titles such as {{% game 93 %}}El Grande{{% /game %}}, {{% game 54 %}}Tikal{{% /game %}} and {{% game 88 %}}Torres{{% /game %}}, which would be considered complex for a {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} by today's standards. So were people really smarter back then or had a longer attention span? Or did the jury actually make mistakes in that period and lost a lot of people's trust?

I don't have any evidence for either interpretation ‚Äì maybe people were excitedly playing {{% game 93 %}}El Grande{{% /game %}} with grandma and grandchild, or maybe those winners gathered dust on many shelves. What we do know is how this era came to an end: with a big scandal. In the early 2000s, the {{% sdj / %}} was financing a game archive and had to pick winners that would sell well to keep the money flowing. This kind of financial commitment put a lot of pressure on the jury and curtails their independence. A winner like {{% game 98778 %}}Hanabi{{% /game %}} (which retails for less than ten euros) would have been unthinkable under those circumstances.

Overall, those years between 1996 and 2001 were hardly a golden age to be nostalgic about, but rather something of a dark period. Luckily, the jury today operates much more transparently, is very careful about any financial commitment they make and will emphasise their independence every chance they get.


# Important points to make

- Mission: Kulturgut Spiel (creativity)
- Large windfall for a handful of publishers
- Relevance to "gamers" and internationally
  - Games I might have missed
  - Great recommendations to play with your "non-gamer" friends & family
  - Kinderspiel as a consumer: spot on!
  - Spiel / Kennerspiel / Expertenspiel? (Compare to Golden Ace? Does their expert game award increase sales?)
  - "Things were better back in the days"
    - Do we know that people were actually playing El Grande?
    - Did the jury lose trust during the late 90s?
    - After all, this era came to an end with a big scandal
- "Best" game of the year
- Eligibility criteria (in particular: regular distribution)
- Conclusion: a different award would be possible ‚Äì but would it be a better one, in particular at fulfilling their mission? For me, the jury is doing a great job at being laser focused on their mission


# Do they fulfill their mission?

- Do they fulfill promoting "Kulturgut Spiel" if they only highlight very light games?
- Does their focus harm creativity?


# Does it represent the hobby?

- It doesn't represent the hobby
  - It does, just in a much wider sense than the 'geeks
  - This award is where hobby and mass market intersect most strongly
- That's a Kennerspiel? It's a Kinderspiel!
  - The jury lets people play and observes them, with a wide variety of people
  - They know quite well what difficulty some games pose to people, e.g., not knowing trick taking games, limited communication, the pressure of messing up common goals (letting the team down)
  - They made up the term, so they get to decide what's a Kennerspiel
- There should be an expert game category
  - The jury is very protective of their brand, with a laser focus on their mission promoting games as a cultural asset
  - Expert gamers don't need the guidance SdJ offers
  - SdJ is not an industry award, but a consumer recommendation
- It's irrelevant for "real" gamers
  - Here's a couple of games I probably would've missed if it wasn't for the jury:
    - TODO
- Why does the jury put a heavyweight like Terraforming Mars or Ark Nova on the short- or longlist when they have no chance of winning anyways?
  - Which one is it: Does the jury have no idea about gamers' games? Or should they completely ignore them?
  - It is ambiguous: no expert game awards, but expert game recommendations ‚Äì why?
  - Clearly there are certain games they want to highlight
  - After all, the jury members are "proper" games trough and trough!


# How could the award be improved?

- More categories?
- Clearer criteria?
- They claim to award the best game of the year and they don't!
  - It's easy to mentally add "best" in front of "game of the year", and the jury does say something like this ‚Äì with caveats ‚Äì in their FAQ
  - The name is probably not ideal
  - Relict from foundation in the late 70s, when there were only a handful of eligible games, most of them lighter, so SdJ really went to the best game
  - Now it's much more the best ambassador for the hobby
- SdJ throws a big payday to one publisher, it should spread attention more
  - Valid point, there's just one main winner that takes it all
  - With the jury's focus, there's probably no way around this without watering down the brand
  - Look at other awards with dozen of categories, nobody pays attention (worst offender: the Golden Geek)
  - SdJ jury takes their license fees and try to promote the hobby where they can
  - Forward concrete suggestions to them!
- The criteria (game must be in regular circulation) disadvantage small publishers
  - Probably only relevant for KS and Spielworxx
  - The jury must be able to test exactly the product they'll be recommending to the gamers, so it needs to be the final product in stores, not something that gets changed from a licensor


# Is it relevant internationally?

- Its relevance only comes from its age as the oldest award
  - Classic survivorship bias
  - Probably not true, Origins Award seems older
- People only care about SdJ because it comes from the most important board game country
  - Cause and effect reversed: Germany is the board game centre because of SdJ
  - The public has been consistently guided towards great games for 40 years
  - Even SPIEL in Essen pretty much fell accidentally out of SdJ (at least its location)
- The international audience shouldn't care so much about SdJ
  - Then‚Ä¶ don't‚Ä¶?
  - So many haters imply importance
  - All sorts of other awards are covered, but only SdJ articles get the "who cares" comments
  - There is a valid point: should SdJ expand internationally?


## Notes from Discord

The anecdote goes such that Doiminion was too complex for SdJ and lots of people complained about it, which led to the introduction of Kennerspiel soon after. So no, Dominion would not win SdJ today.

Why is it a problem though that they pick lighter games? We need to keep in mind that SdJ is simply not targeted at us dickheads hanging out on a board game Discord all day long. It's for the kind of people who buy and play one new game a year. I don't think the jury lost any trust with those folks over the past decade. Picks like El Grande probably did lose trust with them. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It's called game of the year, not best game of the year. One might find the "best" somewhat implied, but it's not actually something the jury claims. (Though they do write something along that line in their FAQ, but what consumer is going to read that? üòÖ)

I don't know if their "mission statement" has changed over the years, but the situation definitely has. When they started out 1979, there were only a handful of eligible games (in fact some games got recommended several years in a row), so the intent really was to pick the best game of the year. But the brand recognition is really the only asset the jury has, so they're not going to change it.

I can see the arguments Uli and some other gamers make, the award would just be a very different one. Could it be a better one? Maybe. But of course the jury will protect the trust and the brand they've built.

I really found Uli's point about "Kulturgut Spiel" very profound. It's really a fair question if the jury satisfies their own claim of promoting games as cultural assets. If games are to be taken seriously as art and even subjects of academic study, is them only putting very light games into the spotlight really doing justice to the artform? Fascinating topic!

There's been some discussion about the lack of political organisation within the German board game publishers. There's no central lobby group and hence very little political attention to board gaming.

I'm not sure if I'd describe SdJ as a competition to begin with. It's always been a dozen or so self appointed people who pick one game a year (or three by now) by their own subjective criteria to put a sticker on. The jury is, and always has been, ultimately only accountable to themselves, for better or for worse.

There actually was a pretty big scandal in the early noughties when SdJ was financing a game archive. Because of this financial commitment, there was pressure of a steady income through their license fees. A winner like Hanabi would have been unthinkable under those circumstances.

The current jury is fiercely independent, and I think it's for the better this way.

Fair enough, with "fiercely independent" I've mostly quoted their own claims here, which obviously should be challenged. I do think it's fair to say that the current jury lives much more up to that independence claim than 20 years ago, which isn't to say they can't improve.

I don't know if I agree all awards should or need such clearly defined criteria. Nobel prizes maybe, but a game award that's ultimately (and slightly reductive) a buyer's guide? Not sure it would benefit.
Would you say that other game awards, eg, the Golden Geek, have clearly defined criteria?

When you tell the jury members that they should decide according to some clear and objective criteria, I think they'd get offend and respond that they are no product testers üòÖ

Arguably, the criterion for SdJ is that's it's a jury vote. Then the problem rather becomes the small size of the jury, which is something that Uli mentioned too.

I was more concretely thinking of comparing game reviews to "Stiftung Warentest", ie, just ticking off "objective criteria".

This is something I've been thinking of in a lot of this SdJ discussion: we're expecting a lot from this award, exactly because of its singular importance to the hobby. Probably we're expecting too much from a group of 12 people who do that as an unpaid side gig. üòÖ It'd be great if there was a well organised lobby to fight for Kulturgut Spiel in politics and society, an industry award to recognise outstanding achievement without having to worry about how approachable a game is, etc.

> Uli: I¬¥m totally fine with the award - as I said, it is a net "plus". However, I also think that it is bad for creativity and that its rules are questionable.  It shovels a lot of money into the hands of (too) few people -  in the end it is an industry and trade award. But wer¬¥e spending way too much energy on all this.

Attention is a very limited resource, so if the long and short list were two separate events, there's the real risk that the wider media would ignore one (or even both) of those events, effectively given less attention to some set of those games instead of more. I agree, for us gamers it would be great to have some time with and more attention to the longlist, but there are potential downsides.

I do agree that having separate announcements would have some benefits and would be worth a try. Looking a little around the general media, it's not like the recommended games could get less coverage. üòÖ

I think there's also the human factor - my understanding is that the jury meets for a couple of days in person to decide long and short list (there's the wonderful German word Klausurtagung üá©üá™). If those were separate decisions, they'd probably need another meeting. That could be too big an ask for an unpaid side gig.

I don't think money would be the limiting factor ‚Äì what I mean is that the jury members have families and other jobs, so being away for yet another weekend might not be an option. But to be clear: this is pure speculation. I can also speculate that the timeline would become tricky: they will now fly in Matt Dunstan from Australia and Matt Leacock from California, so this needs at least a month or so between nominations and winners. If the longlist is announced separately, they'll want a couple of weeks in between, both for effect and to have time for real testing. And of course they want to catch the releases from Nuremberg. (I don't know if that's super relevant anymore, but I think that's the traditional reason for the March deadline.) Add all of those up, and it might be tricky to announce the winners on time to get them to retail in large quantity for autumn.

But I disagree we spend too much time on it (not just because I'm a bit of a SdJ fanboy üòâ ): I can experience Kinderspiel like a regular consumer. I really rely on the jury for recommendations what games to play with my kids. I can verify that all the recent winners have been hits with my kids. So at least that jury is doing a great job with the target audience, as verified with my sample size of 2. üòé


## From BGG

I'd like to add to this that I - like every single person hanging out on BGG - am not the target audience of SdJ nor Kennerspiel, but I'm very much seeing Kinderspiel like the average person would see SdJ: I'm really curious to try out new and interesting children's games, but I spend zero time researching them. I really rely on the jury to find the best games to try out with my kids and I can certify that they've been doing a great job. üòé 

To add another point to consider for the "everything was better back in the days" crowd: Most Spiel winners were fairly light for the majority of the award's lifetime. The constantly quoted winners like CATAN (which Harald Schraper, the jury chairman, would still consider for Spiel, not Kennerspiel, btw), El Grande and Tikal were really outliers in the second half of the 90s, and the latter two were arguably a mistake already back then. Also worth mentioning that there was a sizeable scandal in the early naughties which made a large chunk of the jury resign. So much for the "good old days".
