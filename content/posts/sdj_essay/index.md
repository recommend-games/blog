## From the notebook

- It doesn't represent the hobby
  - It does, just in a much wider sense than the 'geeks
  - This award is where hobby and mass market intersect most strongly
- That's a Kennerspiel? It's a Kinderspiel!
  - The jury lets people play and observes them, with a wide variety of people
  - They know quite well what difficulty some games pose to people, e.g., not knowing trick taking games, limited communication, the pressure of messing up common goals (letting the team down)
  - They made up the term, so they get to decide what's a Kennerspiel
- There should be an expert game category
  - The jury is very protective of their brand, with a laser focus on their mission promoting games as a cultural asset
  - Expert gamers don't need the guidance SdJ offers
  - SdJ is not an industry award, but a consumer recommendation
- It's irrelevant for "real" gamers
  - Here's a couple of games I probably would've missed if it wasn't for the jury:
    - TODO
- They claim to award the best game of the year and they don't!
  - It's easy to mentally add "best" in front of "game of the year", and the jury does say something like this – with caveats – in their FAQ
  - The name is probably not ideal
  - Relict from foundation in the late 70s, when there were only a handful of eligible games, most of them lighter, so SdJ really went to the best game
  - Now it's much more the best ambassador for the hobby
- Its relevance only comes from its age as the oldest award
  - Classic survivorship bias
  - Probably not true, Origins Award seems older
- People only care about SdJ because it comes from the most important board game country
  - Cause and effect reversed: Germany is the board game centre because of SdJ
  - The public has been consistently guided towards great games for 40 years
  - Even SPIEL in Essen pretty much fell accidentally out of SdJ (at least its location)
- The international audience shouldn't care so much about SdJ
  - Then… don't…?
  - So many haters imply importance
  - All sorts of other awards are covered, but only SdJ articles get the "who cares" comments
  - There is a valid point: should SdJ expand internationally?
- The jury is too small
  - Yes, but: it's hard to expand since a membership is a lot to ask
  - While the jury is small (compared to, e.g., the Oscars), you've got to remember that each member plays with dozens of people, so despite only 12 members in the jury, they do represent the taste and opinions of hundreds of people
- SdJ throws a big payday to one publisher, it should spread attention more
  - Valid point, there's just one main winner that takes it all
  - With the jury's focus, there's probably no way around this without watering down the brand
  - Look at other awards with dozen of categories, nobody pays attention (worst offender: the Golden Geek)
  - SdJ jury takes their license fees and try to promote the hobby where they can
  - Forward concrete suggestions to them!
- The criteria (game must be in regular circulation) disadvantage small publishers
  - Probably only relevant for KS and Spielworxx
  - The jury must be able to test exactly the product they'll be recommending to the gamers, so it needs to be the final product in stores, not something that gets changed from a licensor
- Why does the jury put a heavyweight like Terraforming Mars or Ark Nova on the short- or longlist when they have no chance of winning anyways?
  - Which one is it: Does the jury have no idea about gamers' games? Or should they completely ignore them?
  - It is ambiguous: no expert game awards, but expert game recommendations – why?
  - Clearly there are certain games they want to highlight
  - After all, the jury members are "proper" games trough and trough!
- The judges are pre-programmed
  - They claim to be fiercely independent
  - Scandal in the early 2000s when SdJ was financing a game archive
  - They observe play with lots of people, incl target audience
  - Still painfully white though (at least much younger and more female than they used to be)
- Flamme Rouge should have been SdJ!
  - Yes, it should have been 😎


## Notes from Discord

The anecdote goes such that Doiminion was too complex for SdJ and lots of people complained about it, which led to the introduction of Kennerspiel soon after. So no, Dominion would not win SdJ today.

Why is it a problem though that they pick lighter games? We need to keep in mind that SdJ is simply not targeted at us dickheads hanging out on a board game Discord all day long. It's for the kind of people who buy and play one new game a year. I don't think the jury lost any trust with those folks over the past decade. Picks like El Grande probably did lose trust with them. 🤷‍♂️

It's called game of the year, not best game of the year. One might find the "best" somewhat implied, but it's not actually something the jury claims. (Though they do write something along that line in their FAQ, but what consumer is going to read that? 😅)

I don't know if their "mission statement" has changed over the years, but the situation definitely has. When they started out 1979, there were only a handful of eligible games (in fact some games got recommended several years in a row), so the intent really was to pick the best game of the year. But the brand recognition is really the only asset the jury has, so they're not going to change it.

I can see the arguments Uli and some other gamers make, the award would just be a very different one. Could it be a better one? Maybe. But of course the jury will protect the trust and the brand they've built.

I really found Uli's point about "Kulturgut Spiel" very profound. It's really a fair question if the jury satisfies their own claim of promoting games as cultural assets. If games are to be taken seriously as art and even subjects of academic study, is them only putting very light games into the spotlight really doing justice to the artform? Fascinating topic!

There's been some discussion about the lack of political organisation within the German board game publishers. There's no central lobby group and hence very little political attention to board gaming.

I'm not sure if I'd describe SdJ as a competition to begin with. It's always been a dozen or so self appointed people who pick one game a year (or three by now) by their own subjective criteria to put a sticker on. The jury is, and always has been, ultimately only accountable to themselves, for better or for worse.

There actually was a pretty big scandal in the early noughties when SdJ was financing a game archive. Because of this financial commitment, there was pressure of a steady income through their license fees. A winner like Hanabi would have been unthinkable under those circumstances.

The current jury is fiercely independent, and I think it's for the better this way.

Fair enough, with "fiercely independent" I've mostly quoted their own claims here, which obviously should be challenged. I do think it's fair to say that the current jury lives much more up to that independence claim than 20 years ago, which isn't to say they can't improve.

I don't know if I agree all awards should or need such clearly defined criteria. Nobel prizes maybe, but a game award that's ultimately (and slightly reductive) a buyer's guide? Not sure it would benefit.
Would you say that other game awards, eg, the Golden Geek, have clearly defined criteria?

When you tell the jury members that they should decide according to some clear and objective criteria, I think they'd get offend and respond that they are no product testers 😅

Arguably, the criterion for SdJ is that's it's a jury vote. Then the problem rather becomes the small size of the jury, which is something that Uli mentioned too.

I was more concretely thinking of comparing game reviews to "Stiftung Warentest", ie, just ticking off "objective criteria".

This is something I've been thinking of in a lot of this SdJ discussion: we're expecting a lot from this award, exactly because of its singular importance to the hobby. Probably we're expecting too much from a group of 12 people who do that as an unpaid side gig. 😅 It'd be great if there was a well organised lobby to fight for Kulturgut Spiel in politics and society, an industry award to recognise outstanding achievement without having to worry about how approachable a game is, etc.

> Uli: I´m totally fine with the award - as I said, it is a net "plus". However, I also think that it is bad for creativity and that its rules are questionable.  It shovels a lot of money into the hands of (too) few people -  in the end it is an industry and trade award. But wer´e spending way too much energy on all this.

Attention is a very limited resource, so if the long and short list were two separate events, there's the real risk that the wider media would ignore one (or even both) of those events, effectively given less attention to some set of those games instead of more. I agree, for us gamers it would be great to have some time with and more attention to the longlist, but there are potential downsides.

I do agree that having separate announcements would have some benefits and would be worth a try. Looking a little around the general media, it's not like the recommended games could get less coverage. 😅

I think there's also the human factor - my understanding is that the jury meets for a couple of days in person to decide long and short list (there's the wonderful German word Klausurtagung 🇩🇪). If those were separate decisions, they'd probably need another meeting. That could be too big an ask for an unpaid side gig.

I don't think money would be the limiting factor – what I mean is that the jury members have families and other jobs, so being away for yet another weekend might not be an option. But to be clear: this is pure speculation. I can also speculate that the timeline would become tricky: they will now fly in Matt Dunstan from Australia and Matt Leacock from California, so this needs at least a month or so between nominations and winners. If the longlist is announced separately, they'll want a couple of weeks in between, both for effect and to have time for real testing. And of course they want to catch the releases from Nuremberg. (I don't know if that's super relevant anymore, but I think that's the traditional reason for the March deadline.) Add all of those up, and it might be tricky to announce the winners on time to get them to retail in large quantity for autumn.

But I disagree we spend too much time on it (not just because I'm a bit of a SdJ fanboy 😉 ): I can experience Kinderspiel like a regular consumer. I really rely on the jury for recommendations what games to play with my kids. I can verify that all the recent winners have been hits with my kids. So at least that jury is doing a great job with the target audience, as verified with my sample size of 2. 😎


## From BGG

I'd like to add to this that I - like every single person hanging out on BGG - am not the target audience of SdJ nor Kennerspiel, but I'm very much seeing Kinderspiel like the average person would see SdJ: I'm really curious to try out new and interesting children's games, but I spend zero time researching them. I really rely on the jury to find the best games to try out with my kids and I can certify that they've been doing a great job. 😎 

To add another point to consider for the "everything was better back in the days" crowd: Most Spiel winners were fairly light for the majority of the award's lifetime. The constantly quoted winners like CATAN (which Harald Schraper, the jury chairman, would still consider for Spiel, not Kennerspiel, btw), El Grande and Tikal were really outliers in the second half of the 90s, and the latter two were arguably a mistake already back then. Also worth mentioning that there was a sizeable scandal in the early naughties which made a large chunk of the jury resign. So much for the "good old days".
