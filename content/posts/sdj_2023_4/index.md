The cat's out of the bag and the winners [have been announced](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/spiel-des-jahres-2023-dorfromantik/)!

This year's show was… long… On the one hand, it's nice to have all three awards (including the {{% kindersdj %}}Kinderspiel{{% /kindersdj %}}) back together in one announcement, but on the other hand, once you add special awards, the review of the 1983 awards, interviews etc, even die hard fans (and obviously I'm one of them) have a hard time keeping their attention up. The jury is clearly actively trying to improve the award ceremony, so hopefully next year everything will be a bit snappier.

But without further ado, here are the winners of {{% sdj / %}} and {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2023{{% /kdj %}}!

*1–6 players, 30–60 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (1.7)*

In the end, the main award went to what most observers (myself included) considered the favourite. I guess I should be happy the jury didn't pick {{% game 353545 %}}Next Station: London{{% /game %}}, so I don't have to stop being {{% sdj / %}}'s fanboy. 😅

Maybe we can continue the co-op vs solo game discussion some other time, but for now I really do think this is a very pleasing puzzle, whether on your own or with friends, and it'll make a great ambassador for the hobby, maybe even pull in a video gamer or two. I don't think it'll knock anybody off their socks or redefine their expectations of board gaming, but they'll have a good time, and that's what matters most.
