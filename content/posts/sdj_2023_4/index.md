The cat's out of the bag and the winners [have been announced](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/en/spiel-des-jahres-2023-dorfromantik/)!

This year's show was‚Ä¶ long‚Ä¶ On the one hand, it's nice to have all three awards (including the {{% kindersdj %}}Kinderspiel{{% /kindersdj %}}) back together in one announcement, but on the other hand, once you add special awards, the review of the 1983 awards, interviews etc, even die hard fans (and obviously I'm one of them) have a hard time keeping their attention up. The jury is clearly actively trying to improve the award ceremony, so hopefully next year everything will be a bit snappier.

But without further ado, here are the winners of {{% sdj / %}} and {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2023{{% /kdj %}}!


# {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2023{{% /sdj %}}

{{< img src="sdj-2023" size="x300" alt="Spiel des Jahres 2023" >}}


## {{% game 370591 %}}Dorfromantik: The Board Game{{% /game %}}

*1‚Äì6 players, 30‚Äì60 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (1.7)*

In the end, the main award went to what most observers (myself included) considered the favourite. I guess I should be happy the jury didn't pick {{% game 353545 %}}Next Station: London{{% /game %}}, so I don't have to stop being {{% sdj / %}}'s fanboy. üòÖ

Maybe we can continue the co-op vs solo game discussion some other time, but for now I really do think this is a very pleasing puzzle, whether on your own or with friends, and it'll make a great ambassador for the hobby, maybe even pull in a video gamer or two. I don't think it'll knock anybody off their socks or redefine their expectations of board gaming, but they'll have a good time, and that's what matters most.


# {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2023{{% /kdj %}}

## {{% game 359970 %}}Challengers!{{% /game %}}

*1‚Äì8 players, 45 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (1.8)*

Just as with {{% sdj / %}}, most people's first guess won {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2023{{% /kdj %}}. This decision was somewhat controversial nonetheless: not so much because of the game's qualities, but because of the colour of the award. Some people went full on gatekeeper because the jury called {{% game 359970 %}}Challengers!{{% /game %}} a "connoisseur game" ‚Äì just read through the comment section of [this BGG news article](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/150093/dorfromantik-board-game-wins-2023-spiel-des-jahres) üçø.

It is worth noticing that this year's {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} and {{% kdj / %}} are only separated by 0.1 on BGG's complexity scale (1.7 and 1.8 respectively, at the time of writing). And I certainly have been considering {{% game 359970 %}}Challengers!{{% /game %}} a candidate for {{% sdj / %}} as well. But one also needs to trust the jury in their judgement here who don't blindly follow BGG's data and apply some algorithm (trust me, [I've tried]({{<ref "posts/kennerspiel/index.md">}}) üòÖ), but actually watch a wide spectrum of people play the games and hence understand the difficulty they can present. I highly doubt the 28 people who voted {{% game 359970 %}}Challengers!{{% /game %}} to be a "light" game (complexity: 1) ever tried to explain the game to casual gamers and then leave them to fight their battles alone.

In the end, we're left with a winner that's not quite like any other game out there and hence *could* push people's expectations of board games today. {{% game 359970 %}}Challengers!{{% /game %}} doesn't have the same strategic depth as the other nominees, but if there were no skills involved, how come I fail this consistently with my decks after dozens of games on [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=challengers)? üòâ
