Outline:

- Introduction:
    - Link back to SU&SD article: using number of ratings as proxy for attention (note about the actual data?)
    - How are the number of ratings distributed?
    - Plot of the distribution (not cumulative)
- Gini coefficient:
    - Change PoV to cumulative distribution, i.e., share of all ratings / "attention"
    - Compare perfect equality and perfect inequality
    - Define Gini coefficient
    - What's the value today?
    - Compare to Gini coefficient in actual income inequality?
- Historical perspective:
    - How has the Gini coefficient changed over the years?
    - Plot of the Gini coefficient over time
- Conclusion:
    - Where could this increased inequality come from?
    - What does this mean for the board game industry?
    - What does this mean for the board game community?
