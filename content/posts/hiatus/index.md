The very first [commit](https://gitlab.com/recommend.games/board-game-scraper/-/commit/d46a0867c24c30e8d8f9d70443dda9a2bc145101) to the project "ludoj" was on December 5th, 2016. I [registered the domain Recommend.Games](https://www.whois.com/whois/recommend.games) on November 22nd, 2018. On May 15th, 2020, I published the [first post]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020/index.md">}}) on this blog. Over the years, this site attracted more than 50,000 users, which is a huge number, if you think about it.

**Today, I'd like to inform you that the board game recommendation engine at Recommend.Games will take a hiatus from mid August 2022.**
