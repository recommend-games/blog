Corey Thompson (of [Above Board TV](https://www.youtube.com/@aboveboardTV) and [Dice Tower Dish](https://dicetowerdish.com/) fame) recently raised a [question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3336646/playtesting-327) on the [Board Games Insider podcast](https://boardgamesinsider.com/): "In what year do you think the best titles (highest rated titles) were released?" He actually answered the question twice, first in episode [#328](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/163710/board-games-insider-328-the-one-about-the-spiel-de) based on an analysis he ran a couple of years ago and then again in [#330](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/164172/board-games-insider-330-the-one-about-the-biggest) with more up-to-date data. I'm not going to spoil his answer here â€“ the podcast in general is worth a listen â€“ so go and find those episodes on your favourite podcast platform. But of course I couldn't help but answer the question myself, in the most needlessly thorough way possible. ðŸ¤“

First of all, we need to unwrap what the question asks. Do we look at all the games that were released in a given year and average their ratings? Plain rating or geek score? Do we just could how many top X games were released that year? Or do we look at all the ratings that were cast for all the games from a year and average that way? Any one of those approaches could be valid and are eventually just a choice to make.
