We have some pretty exciting news! ðŸ¤© Since 2022-02-22, we've been using a new and improved ranking as the default sorting for our front page at [Recommend.Games](https://recommend.games/).

â€¦ What do you mean, you haven't noticed there's a R.G ranking? You know, that thing that's referenced in the [statistics](https://recommend.games/#/stats)? â€¦ You haven't ever opened that view?!? ðŸ˜±

OK, let's back up for a second. R.G's primary purpose is a recommendation engine, that is, finding personalised game recommendations based on a user's preferences (in this case as expressed through their [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) ratings). But we want to show some games to the users immediately when they load the start page, before entering their user name. Think of these games as recommendations forâ€¦ anyone. What games would you recommend to a person if you didn't know anything about their taste? This is the implicit purpose of any "Top X entities" list. Since this is a recommendation site, we'd like to make this claim explicit, so the R.G ranking has always been those "recommendations for everyone". What's changed is the way those recommendations are calculated.

Recommendations are based on a technique known as collaborative filtering. Basically, the algorithm tries to learn the users' preferences based on their ratings, find users with similar tastes, and then recommend new games that user might like. R.G uses Apple's implementation [Turi Create](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) for its recommendations, which does a lot of magic ðŸª„ under the hood. One of those magic tricks is that it offers recommendations for users it doesn't know anything about. The algorithm treats those users as new and offers some default recommendations that should be a good starting point for anybody, without any particular context. It's exactly those recommendations that R.G has been using for years as our ranking and default sorting.

So, why change this and create a new ranking? There's a number of problems with the old ranking. For one, it's really swingy.[^stochastic] Seriously, just take a look at the [history](https://recommend.games/#/history/fac):[^smoothed]

Maybe more importantly, the exact algorithm to determine those recommendations for new users is extremely obscure. There's been a [long-standing ticket](https://gitlab.com/recommend.games/board-game-recommender/-/issues/38) to find out what's going on. The answer isn't documented anywhere, but you can find it somewhere in [these lines of code](https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/30eced4508bf86c4c59a1fef96bd0b23363db283/src/toolkits/recsys/models/itemcf.cpp#L194). Let me know if you can make sense of them, I've simply given up at some point.

Instead, I wanted to create a new ranking which I can at least explain. So here goes:

**The basic idea is to calculate the recommended games for all users, and then average those rankings. Those averages would become the Recommend.Games rankings.**

That sounds simple and intuitive, but, as the saying goes, the devil is in the details. For starters, there are over 100,000 games in the BoardGameGeek database, and [over 400,000 users](https://twitter.com/recommend_games/status/1498184269402980355) with at least one rated game. Calculating *all recommendations* for *all users* would therefore mean over 40 billion userâ€“game pairs. That's a lot. ðŸ˜… But really, we don't care if a game is the 1,000th, 10,000th or 100,000th highest rated game. Instead, we only recommend the top 100 games for each user. The highest game on that list receives 100 points, the next 99, and so on, until the 100th game receives a single point from that user. All other games will be awarded 0 points. The we can simply average those points across all users, and voilÃ , those scores become the R.G rankings. ðŸ¤©

[^stochastic]: In case you're curious: The reason why the recommendations are so swingy is because they aren't precisely calculated, but merely approximated by an algorithm called [stochastic gradient descent](https://recommend.games/#/faq#the-1-game-keeps-changing-cant-you-make-up-your-mind), which is inherently non-deterministic.
[^smoothed]: And this is even a smoothed version of the rankings: It uses the average score of one week to determine the ranking in that plot.
