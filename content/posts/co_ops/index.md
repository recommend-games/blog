TODO.

### Outline

- SdJ 2021 had all co-op nominees
- Prosperity Game (1903)
  - Not challenging puzzle, but educational tool
- Murder Off Miami etc (1936â€“1939)
  - Shared puzzle solving, no player agency
- Beat the Clock (1954) and other party games:
  - Often "co-operative" means team play
  - We're only interested in fully co-operative games
- Pandemic as the archetype
  - Fully co-op: win or lose against the game
  - Challenging: losing is a real possiblilty, winning is a real achievement
  - Agency to all players: not just solving a solo puzzle as a group
- Earliest games in general:
  - Landlord's / Prosperity Game (1903)
  - That book about card games
  - Crime solving games from the 40s
  - Some party games / TV show adaptations
  - Educational / propaganda games
  - D&D
  - SH:CD
  - Children's games, e.g., Orchard
  - Lord of the Rings
  - Pandemic
  - Hanabi, Exit, Andor, The Crew, MicroMacro, Paleo, Dorfromantik and other SdJ winners
- SdJ co-op winners
- Only ranked games, i.e., at least 30 ratings
