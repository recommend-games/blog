*For the impatient: If you don't care about the data of previous winners and all you're interested in are the candidates for this year's awards, jump [straight to the list](#candidates-for-span-stylecolor-e30613spiel-des-jahresspan)…*

It's that time of year again when the whole board game scene takes a deep look into their crystal balls: On Monday, May 18, the jury [{{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.com/) will announce the nominees for the game of the year award in Germany. There's a myriad of awards in tabletop gaming, but the *red meeple* is the one everbody is really after. Even international publishers often prioritise releasing their game in Germany before their home country just so it'd be eligible for {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}. It is **that** important!

<!-- ![Spiel des Jahres](/img/sdj-2020.png) -->

Consequently, there are many, many, many lists[^todo] floating around the Internet trying to predict this year's nominees. And this is one of them! Most lists are based on the author's experience and taste, but here we try to take a data driven approach: We'll look at the previous winners, try to derive the jury's (implicit or explicit) criteria, and check what current games that meet those criteria have been rated highly.

You'll actually get two for the price of one: since 2011, in addition to the traditional main award {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} that is targeted at casual gamers, there is also the {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} for those who are ready for a (little) more complex game. There's also a third award {{% color "#009FE3" %}}***Kinderspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} for children's games, but since the author of these lines doesn't know the first thing about this sector (give it another four or five years), we won't talk further about it.


# Analysis of past winners

It's worth recalling what the mission statement of {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} is. The target audience are people that buy maybe one game a year which ends up under the Christmas tree and is meant to be played that very evening with the family. This means a game hoping to decorate itself with the red meeple needs to be accessible in every possible way: affordable price point, short rules, quick play time, yet fun for grandchildren and grandparents alike. Luckily for us, BoardGameGeek quantifies about every aspect of games, so let's look in more details into previous winners and how they scored in those criteria.


## Does the community like {{% color "#E30613" %}}*Spiel des Jahres*{{% /color %}} winners?

First, there's the question if the community at BoardGameGeek and the jury {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} are aligned at all. After all, the former is full of mostly US-centric hardcore gamers, while the latter is exclusively concerned with casual gamers in Germany. Still, when we look at how the BGG crowd has rated the award winners over the last years, the jury seems to have done a good job:

<!-- {{< figure src="/img/sdj/bayes_rating.svg" caption="Geek ratings for Spiel des Jahres and Kennerspiel des Jahres winners" >}} -->
![Geek ratings for Spiel des Jahres and Kennerspiel des Jahres winners](/img/sdj/bayes_rating.svg)
<!-- TODO: add legend to graphic -->

While not every single game was a hit with the geeks, many {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} winners score highly, and particularly there's a clear upwards trend visible over the past decade or so. Granted, this is also the case with recent releases in general, but the point remains that German families and American geeks might agree on some games after all.

With that out of the way, let's examine some of our candidates' particular features.


## How difficult can it be?

BoardGameGeek quantifies a game's weight or complexity on a scale from 1 (*light*) to 5 (*heavy*). Naturally, the accessibility of a {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} pushes them towards the lighter side, though over the years, the jury selected some more complex games as well:

![Complexity of Spiel des Jahres and Kennerspiel des Jahres winners](/img/sdj/complexity.svg)
<!-- TODO: add legend to graphic -->

However, recent years have seen a strong trend towards the *very* light games. In fact, since the introduction of {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} in 2011, only 2012's winner {{% game 107529 %}}Kingdom Builder{{% /game %}} exceeded a complexity rating of 2 (*medium light*) – by 0.07 points. Even said {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}}, whose first few winners hovered around a weight of 3 (*medium*), is drawn more and more towards the 2 mark.

From this we can conclude the {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres 2020***{{% /color %}} will have a complexity rating below **2**, whilst the {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres 2020***{{% /color %}} will not exceed 3 in its compexity, or let's say **3.5**, in case the jury wants to go experimental.


## How long can it take?

In addition to short rules (start quickly), a {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} should also have a short playing time (play quickly). Again, the data confirm this perception:

![Playing times of Spiel des Jahres and Kennerspiel des Jahres winners](/img/sdj/time.svg)
<!-- TODO: add legend to graphic -->

Here, the bands indicate the span of the playing time indicated on the games' boxes, while the dashed lines denotes the mean. Playing times are tricky because publishers *always* lie about them. I suppose they simply don't want to scare away people whose attention spans become ever shorter (thanks for still being with me by the way) with the prospect of sitting through an hour of some ultra nerdy activity. But since everybody lies the same way, we can at least compare games with each other. And again, it becomes obvious how import immediate accessibility is to the jury: The last winner that admitted to having a playing time of more than 45 minutes was 2006's {{% game 21790 %}}Thurn and Taxis{{% /game %}}, and none has exceeded the hour mark since 1999's {{% game 54 %}}Tikal{{% /game %}}.

On the other hand, the jury seems to have no problem with longer playing times for {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}}. The sweet spot still seems to be around 60 minutes, but even 90 or 120 minutes on the box do not exclude a game from the connoisseurs' award.

In conclusion, the {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres 2020***{{% /color %}} will be playable in under **1 hour**, probably even 45 minutes, whilst the {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres 2020***{{% /color %}} might take up to **2 hours**.


## How many players can take part?

The {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel***{{% /color %}}'s character as a family or rather group activity becomes obvious when looking at the supported player counts:

![Player counts of Spiel des Jahres and Kennerspiel des Jahres winners](/img/sdj/players.svg)
<!-- TODO: add legend to graphic -->
<!-- TODO: add recommended counts as well? -->

*Every single winner of either award was playable with 3 and 4 players.* It's just what a typical German family looks like, so there's no way the jury will deviate from this pattern. In fact, there's only two games that were even nominated with a different player count, both pure 2-player-games: {{% game 118048 %}}Targi{{% /game %}} in 2012 and {{% game 12002 %}}Jambo{{% /game %}} in 2005.

Therefore, without a doubt, both {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres 2020***{{% /color %}} and {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres 2020***{{% /color %}} will have to be playable with **3 and 4 players**.


## How old do they have to be?

As I mentioned above, a {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} should bring together children with their grandparents, yet, somewhat surprisingly, publishers don't always seem to trust their games with the younger audience:

![Age recommendations of Spiel des Jahres and Kennerspiel des Jahres winners](/img/sdj/age.svg)
<!-- TODO: add legend to graphic -->

Here the solid line is what's printed on the box, whilst the dotted line is what the community thinks. Similar to playing time, age recommendations are tricky and publishers often have a different opinion on it than players, but usually *in the other direction*. (It's worth noticing though that often there aren't all that many players that "vote" on the age recommendations, so take them with a pinch of salt.)

What stands out in this graphic is that {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} winners often have a recommended age of 12+. Notably, 2016's winner {{% game 178900 %}}Codenames{{% /game %}} has 14+ printed on the box, while the community thinks it's fine to play with children from 10 years of age. Unsurprisingly, the more complex {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}} often has a slightly higher age recommendation, although all winners so far stay below the mark of 12 years.

All of this makes it hard to draw a conclusion. {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} winners can typically be played with 8 to 10 year old children, while a {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} can usually be found in the age range from 10 to 12 years. But because of the somewhat erratic age recommendations, we only stipulate a limit of **14 years** for both {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres 2020***{{% /color %}} and {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres 2020***{{% /color %}}. Still, one can confidently exclude any game that includes adult topics or themes that would put off the younger or older audience.


## Summary of criteria

OK, now we've got an understand what a game needs to look like if it hopes to win the coveted awards. A {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} needs to

* have a complexity rating of **2** (*medium light*) or less and
* be playable in under **60 minutes** (better 45 minutes)
* by (at least) **3 to 4 players**
* with a minimum age of at most **14 years old** (better yet 12 or even 10 years old).

A {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} needs to

* have a complexity rating of **3.5** (*medium*), better 2.5 or less and
* be playable in under **120 minutes** (better 90 minutes)
* by (at least) **3 to 4 players**
* with a minimum age of at most **14 years old** (better yet 12).

Further, we need to talk about a game's release date. It's actually not that easy to exactly pinpoint which games are eligible for the award as the jury generally will consider games that were released between April 2019 and March 2020 *into wider German distribution*. BoardGameGeek keeps record of the year of first release, which could be a limited first print run in a different market. A game that was released years ago in its homecountry might be nominated for {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} years later when it hits the German market. This happened with {{% game 219215 %}}Werewords{{% /game %}} which was first released in 2017, but saw a German edition only in early 2019 and was nominated that year. So by simply filtering on the year in the BGG database we might miss some releases, but *c'est la vie*…

Without further ado, let's look at this years candidates that meet all those criteria!

## What the community would pick for {{% color "#E30613" %}}*Spiel des Jahres*{{% /color %}}

First, let's look at the games that meet the above criteria released in 2019 and 2020, [sorted by their rating on BoardGameGeek](https://recommend.games/#/?complexityMax=2&complexityMin=1&ordering=bgg&playTime=60&playTimeType=max&playerAge=14&playerAgeType=box&playerCount=3&playerCountType=box&yearMax=2020&yearMin=2019). When you click on that link, the list you'll see might be very different from what I worked with if some time has passed, so don't be confused if the names you read here are very different. Also, I'll skip any games that are ineligible for one reason or another.

Note that you get essentially the same list when looking at the [Recommend.Games ratings](https://recommend.games/#/?complexityMax=2&complexityMin=1&playTime=60&playTimeType=max&playerAge=14&playerAgeType=box&playerCount=3&playerCountType=box&yearMax=2020&yearMin=2019).
