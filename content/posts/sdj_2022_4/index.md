The cat's out of the bag and the winners [have been announced](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/cascadia-ist-das-spiel-des-jahres-2022/)! As mentioned before, this year was the first time the ceremony was held on a Saturday evening and I had the immense pleasure of attending it live. In case you missed my very proffesional live coverage on Twitter, here's a [summary](https://twitter.com/MarkusRShepherd/status/1553060952559452160?s=20&t=cr68YeOuUltbs57V050Umg) of the event.

But without further ado, here are the winners of {{% sdj / %}} and {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2022{{% /kdj %}}!


# {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2022{{% /sdj %}}

In the end, it was the favourite that won {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2022{{% /sdj %}}. It's the first award I called wrong in three years â€“ still not a bad quota I guess. ðŸ¤· Somewhat ironically, {{% game 295947 %}}Cascadia{{% /game %}} remains the only game of the six nominees I haven't played yet, but after playing {{% game 291453 %}}SCOUT{{% /game %}} and {{% game 300905 %}}Top Ten{{% /game %}}, I do see how those games might not be for everyone. On the other hand, the positivity towards {{% game 295947 %}}Cascadia{{% /game %}} was overwhelming â€“ it's rare to see the 'geek crowd being so enthusiastic about the jury's decision. All in all, it appears {{% game 295947 %}}Cascadia{{% /game %}} will make a great ambassador for the hobby board gaming.


# {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2022{{% /kdj %}}

{{< img src="ksdj-2022" size="x300" alt="Kennerspiel des Jahres 2022" >}}


## {{% game 328479 %}}Living Forest{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 40 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2)*

This award I got right, and as you could read from my [previous post]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2022_3/index.md">}}), I very much agree with this decision. Similar to the {{% sdj %}}red award{{% /sdj %}}, I could see good reasons why the other {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} nominees {{% game 246784 %}}Cryptid{{% /game %}} and {{% game 316554 %}}Dune: Imperium{{% /game %}} have a bit narrower audiences, but I think {{% game 328479 %}}Living Forest{{% /game %}} hits the sweetspot of a games that's "one step up" from a {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} whilst still remaining fairly accessible. I'm certain many many people will enjoy planting those trees and extinguishing those forest fires as much as I do.


# Conclusion

I feel like I say this every year, but I think we've had another very strong year with six excellent nominees that also were very different from each other. I blame the uniform strength on my first wrong call since I started these predictions. ðŸ˜‰

Attending the award ceremony will make this a very special year for me, and I hope I'll soon find the time to write a little article about my experience in Berlin.

As always, this has been great fun and I hope to be back with my predictions for {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2023{{% /sdj %}}!
