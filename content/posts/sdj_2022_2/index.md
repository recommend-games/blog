[Nominations are out](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/aktuelle-preistraeger-2022/)! The jury selected a total of fifteen games for their longlist, nine for {{% sdj / %}} and six for {{% kdj / %}}. Out of these games, three games each are nominated for the two awards and can hope to get the coveted meeple added to their covers on July 16.

Let's dive straight into the nominations and recommendations, before we discuss how good (or bad) [my predictions]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2022/index.md">}}) were and if the agreed with our [{{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} score]({{<ref "posts/kennerspiel/index.md">}}).


# Nominated for {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2022{{% /sdj %}}

{{< img src="sdj-2022" size="x300" alt="Spiel des Jahres 2022" >}}


## {{% game 295947 %}}Cascadia{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 30â€“45 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (1.9), 53% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="295947" size="x300" alt="Cascadia" >}}

It's probably safe to say this was the most mentioned game for a nomination. The question wasn't so much *if* {{% game 295947 %}}Cascadia{{% /game %}} would be nominated, but *where*: our algorithm classified it as a {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} (just about, more on this below), but the jury put it on the {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} list in the end. The game has been discussed now so much that many consider it the favourite for the win, but I think the competion is very strong.


## {{% game 291453 %}}SCOUT{{% /game %}}

*2â€“5 players, 15 minutes, 9+ years, light (1.4), 98% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="291453" size="x300" alt="SCOUT" >}}

{{% game 291453 %}}SCOUT{{% /game %}} was one of the game I really had to mention because there were some strong reviews, but the algorithm didn't quite pick it up. (It was #39 on my [predictions list](predictions.csv).) Availability seems very patchy and a significant number of commentators could have seen it on the {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} list instead, so this getting nominated is still a bit of a surprise in the end.


## {{% game 300905 %}}Top Ten{{% /game %}}

*4â€“9 players, 30 minutes, 14+ years, light (1.1), 98% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="300905" size="x300" alt="Top Ten" >}}

While not entirely new in its core concept, the jury's reviews of {{% game 300905 %}}Top Ten{{% /game %}} were so strong that I was the most certain about this one being nominated. There's plenty of people who seem unhappy about the prospect of "yet another party game" winning {{% sdj / %}}, but I'm sure the jury has a much better insights into what the market craves for than anybody else.


## {{% sdj / %}} recommendations

* {{% game 346703 %}}7 Wonders: Architects{{% /game %}}: One of the more expected recommendations. A crowd pleaser without being very exciting or new either.
* {{% game 342207 %}}echoes: The Dancer{{% /game %}}: I've definitely had this series on my radar (if you pardon the pun), but the algorithm put {{% game 342210 %}}echoes: The Cocktail{{% /game %}} as the highest bet on #46. By the way: this recommendation "proves" that the jury doesn't shy away from app assisted games. They care much more about spreading board gaming to wider circles than gatekeeping "the pure lore".
* {{% game 303669 %}}Magic Rabbit{{% /game %}}: Every year, the jury has some surprises in store, and this is definitely one of them. According to BGG, it was first released in 2020, and the lack of mentioning it elsewhere meant that our algorithm completely missed it. ðŸ¤· A super quick co-operative deduction game does sound like an intriguing proposition though.
* {{% game 331571 %}}My Gold Mine{{% /game %}}: The other big surprise on the list. It seems on the border to {{% kindersdj %}}Kinderspiel{{% /kindersdj %}}, which might partially explain why the algorithm placed it only at #49.
* {{% game 329839 %}}So Clover!{{% /game %}}: I even saw this as a candidate for a nomination, so the recommendation is well expected.
* {{% game 303672 %}}Trek 12: Himalaya{{% /game %}}: At #15 on the predictions, I'd call this a near miss. The jury has given the spotlight to many roll & write games over the year, and it appears this one offers enough new ideas to the genre for a recommendation.


# Nominated for {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2022{{% /kdj %}}

{{< img src="ksdj-2022" size="x300" alt="Kennerspiel des Jahres 2022" >}}


## {{% game 246784 %}}Cryptid{{% /game %}}

*3â€“5 players, 30â€“50 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 74% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="246784" size="x300" alt="Cryptid" >}}

{{% game 246784 %}}Cryptid{{% /game %}} was the #1 candidate for the algorithm, so the nomination does not come as a surprise from that perspective, though deduction games haven't received that much recognition by the jury lately.


## {{% game 316554 %}}Dune: Imperium{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 60â€“120 minutes, 14+ years, medium (3.0), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="316554" size="x300" alt="Dune: Imperium" >}}

The possibility of a nomination for {{% game 316554 %}}Dune: Imperium{{% /game %}} was heavily discussed beforehand, but less because of the actual game and more about the question if the jury would give recognition to a game with a strong franchise. Indeed, this hasn't really happened since {{% game 823 %}}The Lord of the Rings{{% /game %}} more than two decades ago, so this alone speaks volumes to the quality of this game.


## {{% game 328479 %}}Living Forest{{% /game %}}

*1â€“4 players, 40 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 77% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="328479" size="x300" alt="Living Forest" >}}

Following the enthusiastic reviews by jury members, anything but a nomination for {{% game 328479 %}}Living Forest{{% /game %}} would have been a surprise. As it stands, these praises also make it the early favourite to win {{% kdj / %}}, but there's still plenty of time until the final decision in July.

* {{% game 299684 %}}KhÃ´ra: Rise of an Empire{{% /game %}}
