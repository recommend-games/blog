{{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} and {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} winners are due to be announced on Monday, July 20. I promised [last time]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020_2/index.md">}}) I'd be back with more detailed analyses and predictions. So here we go!

Out of hundreds of games published in 2019 and 2020, the jury selected a total fifteen games they recommend, six of which they nominated for the two main awards. But who is the favourite? Who is the dark horse? Let's find out!


# {{% color "#E30613" %}}*Spiel*{{% /color %}} or {{% color "#193F4A" %}}*Kennerspiel*{{% /color %}}?

One of the main conclusions of my [original article]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020/index.md">}}) was that {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} winners tend to be ever lighter and faster. Concretely, no red meeple was pinned on a game whose complexity exceeded **2** on BoardGameGeek's complexity scale (*medium light*) since 2012, so I drew a hard line and claimed that no game would be nominated if it broke that pattern.

I was wrong.

Out of the six nominees, four could have been nominated for either award. Jury member [Udo Bartsch wrote an interesting article](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/rot-oder-anthrazit-spiele-im-grenzbereich/) explaining why the jury decided one way or another. I think the main take away is that BGG's complexity rating is just too crude a measure. To their credit, they admit as much and only make a [half-hearted attempt](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Weight) in defining what they even mean by weight or complexity. In essence, the tension lies between how hard it is to *learn* a game vs how hard it is to *master* it. The ancient game of {{% game 188 %}}Go{{% /game %}} provides an excellent example: while the rules are very quickly explained, playing the game *well* easily fills a lifetime. Consequently, the complexity ratings spread over the whole scale from 1 through 5.

Back in 2020, we still are no closer to quantifying what games qualify for {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} or {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}}. According to Udo Bartsch, it's about the barrier that needs to be taken to immerse oneself in the experience. It's about that *Aha!* moment when the penny finally drops and the game behind all the cardboard shines through. I'm not sure we'll ever find an objective measure for that.
