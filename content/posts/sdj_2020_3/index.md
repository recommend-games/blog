{{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} and {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} winners are due to be announced on Monday, July 20. I promised [last time]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020_2/index.md">}}) I'd be back with more detailed analyses and predictions. So here we go!

Out of hundreds of games published in 2019 and 2020, the jury selected a total fifteen games they recommend, six of which they nominated for the two main awards. But who is the favourite? Who is the dark horse? Let's find out!


# {{% color "#E30613" %}}*Spiel*{{% /color %}} or {{% color "#193F4A" %}}*Kennerspiel*{{% /color %}}?

One of the main conclusions of my [original article]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020/index.md">}}) was that {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} winners tend to be ever lighter and faster. Concretely, no red meeple was pinned on a game whose complexity exceeded **2** on BoardGameGeek's complexity scale (*medium light*) since 2012, so I drew a hard line and claimed that no game would be nominated if it broke that pattern.

I was wrong.

Out of the six nominees, four could have been nominated for either award. Jury member [Udo Bartsch wrote an interesting article](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/rot-oder-anthrazit-spiele-im-grenzbereich/) explaining why the jury decided one way or another. I think the main take away is that BGG's complexity rating is just too crude a measure. To their credit, they admit as much and only make a [half-hearted attempt](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Weight) in defining what they even mean by weight or complexity. In essence, the tension lies between how hard it is to *learn* a game vs how hard it is to *master* it. The ancient game of {{% game 188 %}}Go{{% /game %}} provides an excellent example: while the rules are very quickly explained, playing the game *well* easily fills a lifetime. Consequently, the complexity ratings spread over the whole scale from 1 through 5.

Back in 2020, we still are no closer to quantifying what games qualify for {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} or {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}}. According to Udo Bartsch, it's about the barrier that needs to be taken to immerse oneself in the experience. It's about that *Aha!* moment when the penny finally drops and the game behind all the cardboard shines through. I'm not sure we'll ever find an objective measure for that.

I already introduced the nominees in the [previous article]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020_2/index.md">}}), along with their characteristics and a brief assessment of their respective chances of winning an award, so this will be just a reminder and update where necessary.


## {{% game 295486 %}}My City{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="295486" size="x300" alt="My City" >}}

This entry level legacy game designed by Reiner Knizia was the most surprising on the {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} list as its complexity was higher than any of the {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}} nominees at that time. The rating has gone down since (with significantly more votes), but still stays firmly above that magical line of **2**. As mentioned previously, its campaign character works in its favour, allowing players to approach the game step by step.


## {{% game 284435 %}}Nova Luna{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="284435" size="x300" alt="Nova Luna" >}}

A fairly abstract puzzle, this one's not typical for {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} – but then again, {{% game 230802 %}}Azul{{% /game %}} won not too long ago with a similar proposition.


## {{% game 284108 %}}Pictures{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="284108" size="x300" alt="Pictures" >}}

As I stated before, this one *is* the typical {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} and continues to be the one I'd put my money on. But then again, this year clearly has its spotlight on the heavier games, so we might be in for a surprise.

## {{% game 263918 %}}Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="263918" size="x300" alt="Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale" >}}

Roll and write games have been on the rise for some time, with {{% game 131260 %}}Qwixx{{% /game %}} and {{% game 244522 %}}That's Pretty Clever{{% /game %}} receiving nominations. From what I gather, the buzz around this specimen is not as loud and a win would be a bit of a surprise.


## {{% game 284083 %}}The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="284083" size="x300" alt="The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine" >}}

This is the game everybody is talking about, both before and after the announcements. Still the high favourite for {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}.


## {{% game 245655 %}}King's Dilemma{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="245655" size="x300" alt="King's Dilemma" >}}

I still think that this is a pretty brave nomination by the jury, and I applaud them for it. But despite being nominated as the *connoiseurs' game*, it still needs to appeal to a broad market. Can you imagine a game about intrigue and backstabbing being played around the Christmas tree?
