{{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} and {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} winners are due to be announced on Monday, July 20. I promised [last time]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020_2/index.md">}}) I'd be back with more detailed analyses and predictions. So here we go!

Out of hundreds of games published in 2019 and 2020, the jury selected a total fifteen games they recommend, six of which they nominated for the two main awards. But who is the favourite? Who is the dark horse? Let's find out!


# {{% color "#E30613" %}}*Spiel*{{% /color %}} or {{% color "#193F4A" %}}*Kennerspiel*{{% /color %}}?

One of the main conclusions of my [original article]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020/index.md">}}) was that {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} winners tend to be ever lighter and faster. Concretely, no red meeple was pinned on a game whose complexity exceeded **2** on BoardGameGeek's complexity scale (*medium light*) since 2012, so I drew a hard line and claimed that no game would be nominated if it broke that pattern.

I was wrong.

Out of the six nominees, four could have been nominated for either award. Jury member [Udo Bartsch wrote an interesting article](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/rot-oder-anthrazit-spiele-im-grenzbereich/) explaining why the jury decided one way or another. I think the main take away is that BGG's complexity rating is just too crude a measure. To their credit, they admit as much and only make a [half-hearted attempt](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Weight) in defining what they even mean by weight or complexity. In essence, the tension lies between how hard it is to *learn* a game vs how hard it is to *master* it. The ancient game of {{% game 188 %}}Go{{% /game %}} provides an excellent example: while the rules are very quickly explained, playing the game *well* easily fills a lifetime. Consequently, the complexity ratings spread over the whole scale from 1 through 5.

Back in 2020, we still are no closer to quantifying what games qualify for {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} or {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}}. According to Udo Bartsch, it's about the barrier that needs to be taken to immerse oneself in the experience. It's about that *Aha!* moment when the penny finally drops and the game behind all the cardboard shines through. I'm not sure we'll ever find an objective measure for that.

I already introduced the nominees in the [previous article]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020_2/index.md">}}), along with their characteristics and a brief assessment of their respective chances of winning an award, so here I'll focus on the pros and cons why that game might win the red meeple.


## {{% game 295486 %}}My City{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="295486" size="x300" alt="My City" >}}

### Pros

* Reiner Knizia is en vogue again.
* Legacy / campaign format allows players to ease into the experience.
* Highest average rating on BGG (**7.55**).
* Has been consistently highly recommended to the [`S_d_J` bot](https://recommend.games/#/?yearMin=2019&yearMax=2020&playerCount=3&playerCountType=box&playTime=60&playTimeType=max&playerAge=14&playerAgeType=box&complexityMin=1&complexityMax=2.5&for=S_d_J)

### Cons

* Still very complex (**2.14**) for a {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}.
* That's it, really…


## {{% game 284435 %}}Nova Luna{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="284435" size="x300" alt="Nova Luna" >}}

### Pros

* Uwe Rosenberg has *always* been en vogue.
* The fan favourite so far with the highest geek rating (**6.34**) and leading in [this poll](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2457916/poll-predict-2020-winner-spiel-des-jahres-and-kenn).

### Cons

* Fairly abstract.
* On the heavy side of {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}.


## {{% game 284108 %}}Pictures{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="284108" size="x300" alt="Pictures" >}}

### Pros

* Super simple and quick.
* Typical {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} material.
* Highly recommended to the [`S_d_J` bot](https://recommend.games/#/?yearMin=2019&yearMax=2020&playerCount=3&playerCountType=box&playTime=60&playTimeType=max&playerAge=14&playerAgeType=box&complexityMin=1&complexityMax=2.5&for=S_d_J) *sometimes* – the recommendations tend to be rather volatile.

### Cons

* With {{% game 254640 %}}Just One{{% /game %}} we had a somewhat similar winner last year.
* In its simplicity, it might not have the same staying power as the other nominees.


## Who will win?

Honestly, the numbers don't yield any clear favourite. If I had to make a guess, I'd still put my money on the quick and simple {{% game 284108 %}}Pictures{{% /game %}} ahead of the legacy game {{% game 295486 %}}My City{{% /game %}}, with the abstract {{% game 284435 %}}Nova Luna{{% /game %}} further behind. But overall, the field really seems open. We'll know more on Monday!

{{< img src="ksdj-2020" size="x300" alt="Kennerspiel des Jahres 2020" >}}

Same procedure, let's assess each game's chances of winning the award!

## {{% game 263918 %}}Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="263918" size="x300" alt="Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale" >}}

### Pros

* Roll and write games have been on the rise for some time, with {{% game 131260 %}}Qwixx{{% /game %}} and {{% game 244522 %}}That's Pretty Clever{{% /game %}} receiving nominations.
* The highest rated game in the [Recommend.Games ranking](https://recommend.games/#/?yearMin=2019&yearMax=2020&playerCount=3&playerCountType=box&playTime=60&playTimeType=max&playerAge=14&playerAgeType=box&complexityMin=1&complexityMax=2.5).

### Cons

* It might not have enough meat for a {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}} in the end.
* While there are lots of positive opinions, none seem to be *excited*.


## {{% game 284083 %}}The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="284083" size="x300" alt="The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine" >}}

### Pros

* Already on its way into the BGG top 100 (#124 at the time of writing).
* Consistently and by far the highest recommendation to the [`S_d_J` bot](https://recommend.games/#/?yearMin=2019&yearMax=2020&playerCount=3&playerCountType=box&playTime=60&playTimeType=max&playerAge=14&playerAgeType=box&complexityMin=1&complexityMax=2.5&for=S_d_J).
* Runaway leader in [the poll](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2457916/poll-predict-2020-winner-spiel-des-jahres-and-kenn) I quoted above.

### Cons

* Too obvious choice?


## {{% game 245655 %}}King's Dilemma{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="245655" size="x300" alt="King's Dilemma" >}}

### Pros

* Probably the most innovative game on the list with lots of hype from the community.
* Highest average rating on BGG (**8.12**).

### Cons

* Can you imagine a game about intrigue and backstabbing being played around the Christmas tree?
* *Very* lowly ranked in the recommendations for the [`S_d_J` bot](https://recommend.games/#/?yearMin=2019&yearMax=2020&playerCount=3&playerCountType=box&playTime=60&playTimeType=max&playerAge=14&playerAgeType=box&complexityMin=1&complexityMax=2.5&for=S_d_J).


## Who will win?

Hands down, {{% game 284083 %}}The Crew{{% /game %}} is the high favourite, and any other outcome would be a big surprise. This game seems to appeal to reviewers, the community, and the wider market alike. {{% game 263918 %}}Cartographers{{% /game %}} just doesn't have the same pull, and {{% game 245655 %}}King's Dilemma{{% /game %}} seems to specific for an award that's supposed to reach hundreds of thousands of German *average* gamers.

I hope you're as excited as I am about Monday's announcements. We'll be back with the final conclusions for {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres 2020***{{% /color %}}!
