With {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}, {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}, and {{% color "#009FE3" %}}***Kinderspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} [nominations out](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/aktuelle-preistraeger-2020/), it's time to look at the nominees and to check how I did in [my predictions]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020/index.md">}}).


# Nominated for {{% color "#E30613" %}}*Spiel des Jahres*{{% /color %}}

As every year, the jury nominated three games for the main award, one of which will receive the red meeple in July. In addition to that, there are six games the jury *recommends*. Do these games match the criteria I [stipulated last time]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020/index.md#summary-of-criteria">}})? Let's see!


## {{% game 295486 %}}My City{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="295486" size="x300" alt="My City" >}}

First off, congratulation to Reiner Knizia for the third {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel***{{% /color %}} nomination in four years! Looks like he shows no sign of slowing down…

This title completely slipped under my radar. Not like it wasn't on my mind (sure, *anyone* can claim that), but its complexity is rated at 2.44, *heavier than any of the three {{% color "#193F4A" %}}**Kennerspiel**{{% /color %}} nominees*. Grated, there aren't all that many votes for many of the nominees yet (9 in this particular case), but even with wider opinions, it seems unlikely to end up under the magical mark of 2 I drew as a hard line for {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}.

Of course, the jury just doesn't take to BoardGameGeek to classify a game for either {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel***{{% /color %}} or {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}}, but of course draws their own conclusions. Still, it's a notable outlier. How come?

The best explaination I've got is the game's legacy / campaign format. The advantage this genre has is that it can build up its narrative and unfold the rules as the players progress. This can significantly improve a game's accessibility, which of course is the real feature the jury is after.


## {{% game 284435 %}}Nova Luna{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="284435" size="x300" alt="Nova Luna" >}}

This one was on my shortlist, albeit for {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}}. Its complexity is just short of 2, so it did technically meet that criterion, but the jury's draw towards the *very* light games put {{% game 284435 %}}Nova Luna{{% /game %}} rather outside the sphere of {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} for me. Further, the maximum playing time is stated at 60 minutes, another break of pattern. As I mentioned before, the jury *hates* to be predictable…


## {{% game 284108 %}}Pictures{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="284108" size="x300" alt="Pictures" >}}

The one nominee for the main award I got dead right. Everything about this game looks and feels like a typical {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}. For these reasons and the rather unusual competitors, {{% game 284108 %}}Pictures{{% /game %}} should be an early favourite to take home the coveted red meeple.


## Recommendations

In addition to the three nominees, there's also six games on the jury's long list or recommendation list.

* {{% game 223742 %}}Colour Brain{{% /game %}}: One of those latecomers to Germany, it doesn't seem to have had an impact outside of it *either*…
* {{% game 221965 %}}The Fox in the Forest{{% /game %}}: Another latecomer, yet I'm annoyed at myself for missing it since there's been some excellent reviews by jury members. The only two-player-game mentioned, as expected.
* {{% game 264055 %}}Draftosaurus{{% /game %}}: As predicted recommended, but not nominated.
* {{% game 241266 %}}Little Town{{% /game %}}: Another latecomer, another game above the medium light complexity. Maybe the jury *does* want to highlight more complex games this year, who knows…
* {{% game 287938 %}}Kitchen Rush{{% /game %}}: I called this one, but again for the wrong award due to its complexity. I'll admit I was a little surprised to see it on the list in the end as there were some pretty negative reviews by some jury members.
* {{% game 299169 %}}Spicy{{% /game %}}: What's going on with this game's complexity rating? Is it an *easy to learn, hard to master* situation that makes this a *light* game for two thirds, and a *heavy* game for the other third of the players? Or is it trolling?
