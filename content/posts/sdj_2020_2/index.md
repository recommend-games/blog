With {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} and {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} [nominations out](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/aktuelle-preistraeger-2020/) (setting aside the {{% color "#009FE3" %}}***Kinderspiel***{{% /color %}} again), it's time to look at the nominees and to check how I did in [my predictions]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020/index.md">}}).


# Nominated for {{% color "#E30613" %}}*Spiel des Jahres*{{% /color %}}

{{< img src="sdj-2020" size="x300" alt="Spiel des Jahres 2020" >}}

As every year, the jury nominated three games for the main award, one of which will receive the red meeple in July. In addition to that, there are six games the jury *recommends*. Do these games match the criteria I [stipulated last time]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020/index.md#summary-of-criteria">}})? Let's see!


## {{% game 295486 %}}My City{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="295486" size="x300" alt="My City" >}}

First off, congratulation to Reiner Knizia for the third {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel***{{% /color %}} nomination in four years! Looks like he shows no sign of slowing down…

This title completely slipped under my radar. Not like it wasn't on my mind (sure, *anyone* can claim that), but its complexity is rated at 2.44, *heavier than any of the three {{% color "#193F4A" %}}**Kennerspiel**{{% /color %}} nominees*. Grated, there aren't all that many votes for many of the nominees yet (9 in this particular case), but even with wider opinions, it seems unlikely to end up under the magical mark of 2 I drew as a hard line for {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}.

Of course, the jury just doesn't take to BoardGameGeek to classify a game for either {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel***{{% /color %}} or {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}}, but of course draws their own conclusions. Still, it's a notable outlier. How come?

The best explaination I've got is the game's legacy / campaign format. The advantage this genre has is that it can build up its narrative and unfold the rules as the players progress. This can significantly improve a game's accessibility, which of course is the real feature the jury is after.


## {{% game 284435 %}}Nova Luna{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="284435" size="x300" alt="Nova Luna" >}}

This one was on my shortlist, albeit for {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}}. Its complexity is just short of 2, so it did technically meet that criterion, but the jury's draw towards the *very* light games put {{% game 284435 %}}Nova Luna{{% /game %}} rather outside the sphere of {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} for me. Further, the maximum playing time is stated at 60 minutes, another break of pattern. As I mentioned before, the jury *hates* to be predictable…


## {{% game 284108 %}}Pictures{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="284108" size="x300" alt="Pictures" >}}

The one nominee for the main award I got dead right. Everything about this game looks and feels like a typical {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}. For these reasons and the rather unusual competitors, {{% game 284108 %}}Pictures{{% /game %}} should be an early favourite to take home the coveted red meeple.


## {{% color "#E30613" %}}*Spiel des Jahres*{{% /color %}} recommendations

In addition to the three nominees, there's also six games on the jury's long list or recommendation list.

* {{% game 223742 %}}Colour Brain{{% /game %}}: One of those latecomers to Germany, it doesn't seem to have had an impact outside of it *either*…
* {{% game 221965 %}}The Fox in the Forest{{% /game %}}: Another latecomer, yet I'm annoyed at myself for missing it since there's been some excellent reviews by jury members. The only two-player-game mentioned, as expected.
* {{% game 264055 %}}Draftosaurus{{% /game %}}: As predicted recommended, but not nominated.
* {{% game 241266 %}}Little Town{{% /game %}}: Another latecomer, another game above the medium light complexity. Maybe the jury *does* want to highlight more complex games this year, who knows…
* {{% game 287938 %}}Kitchen Rush{{% /game %}}: I called this one, but again for the wrong award due to its complexity. I'll admit I was a little surprised to see it on the list in the end as there were some pretty negative reviews by some jury members.
* {{% game 299169 %}}Spicy{{% /game %}}: What's going on with this game's complexity rating? Is it an *easy to learn, hard to master* situation that makes this a *light* game for two thirds, and a *heavy* game for the other third of the players? Or is it trolling?


## How good were the predictions?

Time to compare the predictions with reality! As mentioned, I called two out of three nominations, though one for the wrong award. Depending on how strict you are, this makes for a 50% or even 66% success rate, which I am really proud of, given the jury's infamous unpredictability.

However, when looking at the long list of nominations plus recommendations, I only called four out of its nine titles (two of them on the wrong list). I'll try better next year…


# Nominated for {{% color "#193F4A" %}}*Kennerspiel des Jahres*{{% /color %}}

{{< img src="ksdj-2020" size="x300" alt="Kennerspiel des Jahres 2020" >}}

Again, there's three nominations, along with three recommendations, so we'll take a look at each of them.


## {{% game 263918 %}}Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="263918" size="x300" alt="Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale" >}}

Another correctly called, but incorrectly classified. I very much had {{% game 263918 %}}Cartographers{{% /game %}} as "probably nominated, but dunno what list", so it ended up nominated for {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}}. I cannot offer any insights as to why it is a {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}} with a complexity of 1.9, while {{% game 284435 %}}Nova Luna{{% /game %}} at 2.0 and {{% game 295486 %}}My City{{% /game %}} at 2.4 are on the {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel***{{% /color %}} list.


## {{% game 284083 %}}The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="284083" size="x300" alt="The Crew: The Quest for Planet Nine" >}}

While I was confident about the nomination for this one, I had some doubts about the classification as {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel***{{% /color %}}. Its complexity says so, but then again this metric doesn't seem to predict the jury's classification very well. Also, as a campaign game it can ease the player into the game (cf {{% game 295486 %}}My City{{% /game %}}), and traditional trick-taking games are *very* common in Germany, the land of {{% game 6819 %}}Skat{{% /game %}} and {{% game 9364 %}}Doppelkopf{{% /game %}}, so I might have been wrong again. As it stands, {{% game 284083 %}}The Crew{{% /game %}} seems to be the favourite to win {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}.


## {{% game 245655 %}}King's Dilemma{{% /game %}}

{{< img src="245655" size="x300" alt="King's Dilemma" >}}

I'll be honest, I'm probably more excited about this nomination that any other, and the community seems to agree, judging by their reactions. I kinda excluded {{% game 245655 %}}King's Dilemma{{% /game %}} for no good reason other than having a high age recommendation (and even higher when asking the community). It's great to see a more demanding game on the list, but I will say that the jury nominated (relative) heavyweights like {{% game 227789 %}}Heaven & Ale{{% /game %}} and {{% game 167791 %}}Terraforming Mars{{% /game %}} in the past, but didn't give them the award in the end, so I'd think this one will be an *also-ran* as well.


## {{% color "#193F4A" %}}*Kennerspiel des Jahres*{{% /color %}} recommendations

There's three more games that didn't make the cut, but that received a recommendation.

* {{% game 266810 %}}Paladins of the West Kingdom{{% /game %}}: I was confident that this one would receive a recommendation because of [Udo Bartsch's glowing review](https://rezensionen-fuer-millionen.blogspot.com/2020/03/paladine-des-westfrankenreichs.html), but also confident it's too complex for a nomination.
* {{% game 262712 %}}Res Arcana{{% /game %}}: One of the hottest candidate, no surprise to see it on the list.
* {{% game 247763 %}}Underwater Cities{{% /game %}}: This one slipped under my radar as a release from the previous year. Also pretty heavy, so a recommendation is the best possible outcome.


## How good were the predictions?

I was *pretty* happy about my predictions for {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}, I am *very* happy with how the {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} turned out. Of the six title on the long list, I missed only one, and I (pretty much) called all three nominations, even though one on the wrong list, and one for a recommendation, not nomination. Still, this is a good outcome, both for my predictions, and for the hobby gaming in general because I think the jury made a fine selection of games that showcase so much of what games have to offer to new players.

This concludes the discussion of this year's nominations for {{% color "#E30613" %}}***Spiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}} and {{% color "#193F4A" %}}***Kennerspiel des Jahres***{{% /color %}}. I had a lot of fun with it, and I hope so did you. I'll be back in July with more detailed analyses of the nominees and predictions for the winners!
