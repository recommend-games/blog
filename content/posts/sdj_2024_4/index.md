The cat's out of the bag and the winners [have been announced](https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/spiel-des-jahres-2024-sky-team/)!

This yearâ€™s show wasâ€¦ even longerâ€¦ ðŸ˜… After [last year]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2023_4/index.md">}}) I've hoped for a snappier show â€“ instead it was further extended. As much as I appreciate the jury's work (which I've expressed [at length]({{<ref "posts/sdj_essay/index.md">}})), the stage isn't where they shine, so I don't understand why we need two awkward hours of their presence. It's understandable they want to highlight various aspects of board gaming and their activities, since those are the only two hours of attention they get all year, but just as an endless recommendation list would water down the award, the rule in showbiz is to make every minute count.

Anyways, trying not to fall into the same trap, here are the winners of {{% sdj / %}} and {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2024{{% /kdj %}}!

*Pilot and co-pilot work together to land planes.*

To [quote]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2024/index.md">}}#2-a-hrefhttpsrecommendgamesgame373106-stylefont-variant-small-capssky-teama) myself:

> {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} is highly praised, but has next to no chance of winning.

I guess I was wrong. ðŸ˜… It goes to show that any perceived patterns in the jury's decisions are just based on very small samples. Harald Schrapers, the jury chairman, always emphasises that the only thing they really care about is the fun in the game. And by all accounts, no game was as much fun this year as {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}}.

Still, this remains a remarkable choice, because the award's family friendliness was the guiding principle behind the decisions over the past 45 years. It remains to be seen if the market is willing to go along with this new direction.

*1â€“4 players, 60â€“120 minutes, 10+ years, medium (3.0)*

*Cooperatively decarbonize the planet and create resilient societies.*
