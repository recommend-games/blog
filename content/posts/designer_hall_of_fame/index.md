{{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2024{{% /sdj %}} nominations are just around the corner (watch this space for our [annual predictions]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2024/index.md">}})), but I wanted to take this opportunity for a look back over the history of the award. Specifically, I wanted to see which designers have been most successful at the {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}, {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} and {{% kindersdj / %}} awards.

{{< img src="sdj-all" size="x300" alt="Spiel des Jahres" >}}

The first {{% sdj %}}red meeple{{% /sdj %}} was given out in 1979. Since 1989, the jury also awarded the {{% kindersdj / %}} for children's games, initially as an annual special award, and from 2001 as its own award with the {{% kindersdj %}}blue meeple{{% /kindersdj %}}. (In what follows I count those special awards as regular {{% kindersdj / %}} winners.) Finally, in 2011, the {{% kdj / %}} was introduced for (slightly) more complex games with an {{% kdj %}}anthracite meeple{{% /kdj %}}, again following a couple of special awards with a clearly similar intent, but less steady, so they just stand as special awards on their own in the statistics.


## Games

Overall, the jury included 831 games on its various longlist across the three categories over its 45 year history, with (naturally) 45 {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}, 35 {{% kindersdj %}}Kinderspiel{{% /kindersdj %}} and 13 {{% kdj / %}} winners.[^exit] This is the overall number of games:

| Award | Winner | Nominated | Recommended | Special award |
|:-----:|:------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} | 45 | 109 | 482 | 11 |
| {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} | 13 | 39 | 76 | 2 |
| {{% kindersdj %}}Kinderspiel{{% /kindersdj %}} | 35 | 95 | 260 | 1 |

A quick word about the data: As usual, I rely on BoardGameGeek (BGG) for data about the games and their designers. If a game is not in the database or if the designer entry is wrong, the statistics here will necessarily be wrong too. I've collected data about the different {{% sdj / %}} awards manually over the years, so that's another potential source of errors. If you're reading this from the future, I should point out that the statistics here should be complete up to and including {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2023{{% /sdj %}}.

The current format of having a longlist (which become the recommendations), out of which three games are selected for the shortlist (which are the nominated games), out of which one game will be given the award, has been in place since 2011 with the introduction of the {{% kdj / %}}. Formats have varied throughout the decades and I've tried to map them to the current situation as much as possible.

I've already mentioned that the first 12 {{% kindersdj / %}} winners were really special awards. There was another special award given during the first 18 years between 1979 and 1997 for "beautiful games". Since this article is meant to focus on designers, not artists, it felt like those games clutter the statistics somewhat, so I treated them as recommendations rather than special award winners.

So without further ado, let's take a look at the designers.


## Designers

Over the course of 45 sessions, the jury has mentioned games by 566 different designers. By far the most successful designer is [Wolfgang Kramer](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=7) who has won {{% sdj / %}} five times (four of those were co-designs) and {{% kindersdj / %}} once between 1986 and 2000. During that time period, [Klaus Teuber](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=11) won {{% sdj / %}} four times, so during those 15 years Wolfgang & Klaus shared 11 awards between them. The record for most games on the longlists is held by [Reiner Knizia](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=2) with 36 games, which makes it even more surprising that he has "only" won two awards: one each of {{% sdj / %}} and {{% kindersdj / %}} â€“ both in 2008 (and both largely forgotten today, unlike his other timeless designs).

Overall, 94 designers have won at least one award (111 if we include special awards), with 21 of them winning more than one (22 including special awards). Only 8 of those have won their awards in more than one category: [Wolfgang Kramer](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=7), [Inka](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=6940) & [Markus Brand](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=6941), [Alex Randolph](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=24), [Reiner Knizia](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=2), [Bruno Cathala](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=1727), [Antoine Bauza](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=9714) and [Steffen Bogen](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=10067). To this date, no designer has won in all three categories.

Looking at the shortlists (including winners), the jury nominated 217 different designers over the years. Of those, only 22 have been nominated in more than one category and just 4 designers can claim the distinction of being nominated in all three categories: [Wolfgang Kramer](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=7), [Antoine Bauza](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=9714), [RÃ¼diger Dorn](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=381) and [Wolfgang Warsch](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=80162).

As mentioned earlier, the jury has recommended games by 566 different designers, with 68 of them appearing in more than one category and 9 in all three. In addition to the 4 mentioned above, those are [Inka](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=6940) & [Markus Brand](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=6941), [Reiner Knizia](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=2), [Bruno Cathala](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=1727) and [Roberto Fraga](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=285).

I'll leave you with some more detailed statistics below. I hope you enjoy those and they help you bridge the time until the nominations are announced on June 11th. ðŸ¤©

[^exit]: Arguably, there's 15 {{% kdj / %}} winners: In 2017, the jury gave the award to the first three games in the Exit series. In all statistics, I only count them as a single entry. Similarly, in 2019, the first three entries of the Sherlock series got recommended, which I also count as just a single game.
