* Explain the game
* Relate to Orchard, but explain difference (actual strategy and very meaningful decisions)
* How long is a game? (Why should we care?)
* Simulation
* Work backwards, probability of full length, then one card left, etc.
* Exact formula, pedestrian
* Hypergeometric distribution
* Negative hypergeometric distribution
* Are the probabilities always monotonic? Why? Intuition?
* Did Dr Knizia do this calculation? Why did he make the choices he did?
* What if there were different number of cards?
* Conclusion
