{{< img src="sdj-all" size="x300" alt="Spiel des Jahres" >}}

The waiting is finally coming to an end! On Sunday, July 21, the jury will announce the winners of {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres{{% /sdj %}} and {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2024{{% /kdj %}}. We're blessed with another year of very strong games and I'm certainly very excited to learn what games will win the two awards.

I've been doing this [for]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020_3/index.md">}}) [four]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2021_3/index.md">}}) [years]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2022_3/index.md">}}) [now]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2024_3/index.md">}}) and I've called seven out of the eight winners correctly. No reason to rest on any laurels ‚Äì there's another batch of awards coming up, and this year might be the closest race yet!


# Nominated for {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2024{{% /sdj %}}

{{< img src="sdj-2024" size="x300" alt="Spiel des Jahres 2024" >}}

Before we dive into the individual games, let's look at some numbers to see some objective measures for them ‚Äì as far as this is possible. What we've got at our disposal are the [jury's reviews](reviews.csv), [recommendations to the `S_d_J` bot](https://recommend.games/#/?for=S_d_J&yearMin=2024&yearMax=2023&include=376683,393325,373106,350933,390092,334986&excludeRated=false), BoardGameGeek's average rating and the [Bayesian rating]({{<ref "posts/reverse_engineer_bgg/index.md">}}). Additionally, I've created a [poll on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3319930/poll-spiel-des-jahres-2024-and-kennerspiel-des-jah) where the geeks could have their say:

| Game | [Jury](reviews.csv) | [R.G](https://recommend.games/#/?for=S_d_J&yearMin=2024&yearMax=2023&include=376683,393325,373106&excludeRated=false) | Average | Bayes | [Poll](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3319930/poll-spiel-des-jahres-2024-and-kennerspiel-des-jah) |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| {{% game 393325 %}}Captain Flip{{% /game %}} | 7.2 (5) | 5.3 | 7.0 | 6.0 | 28.9% |
| {{% game 376683 %}}In the Footsteps of Darwin{{% /game %}} | 7.0 (3) | 5.1 | 7.4 | 6.2 | 13.2% |
| {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} | **8.8** (4) | **7.0** | **8.2** | **7.5** | **57.9%** |

Obviously, {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} is the high favourite according to all metrics. But will the jury follow the numbers? Let's take a closer look at all the nominees and their pros and cons.


## {{% game 393325 %}}Captain Flip{{% /game %}}

*2‚Äì5 players, 20 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.1)*

{{< img src="393325" size="x300" alt="Captain Flip" >}}

*Hoist your flag, recruit a colorful crew, and earn as many gold coins as you can.*

The first release by [PlayPunk](https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2023/06/20/7-wonders-creator-repos-productions-co-founder-launch-new-publishing-company-playpunk/), co-founded by [hall of fame]({{<ref "posts/designer_hall_of_fame/index.md">}}) member [Antoine Bauza](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=9714), immediately landed them their first nomination. This game is doing to [Paolo Mori](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=7640)'s {{% game 125618 %}}Libertalia{{% /game %}} what {{% game 264055 %}}Draftosaurus{{% /game %}} did to {{% game 68448 %}}7 Wonders{{% /game %}}. That's a lot of {{% sdj / %}} cred in just two sentences.

On the surface, there isn't all that much to this game of flipping tiles and filling your ship with a colourful set of characters. It's quite random and solitaire ‚Äì yet this design somehow manages to pull the magic trick of keeping everyone around the table invested in every single draw and flip of a tile. It's fast, it's immediate, it's fun ‚Äì in other words: it's perfect {{% sdj / %}} material.


## {{% game 376683 %}}In the Footsteps of Darwin{{% /game %}}

*2‚Äì5 players, 20‚Äì30 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (1.6)*

{{< img src="376683" size="x300" alt="In the Footsteps of Darwin" >}}

*Assist Charles Darwin with his research for On the Origins of Species.*

I'll admit I have neither played nor heard all that much about this game until [Ben Maddox's interview](https://youtu.be/gLEq5l4RfWY?si=pHwe9qF5Hpg0eKda) which I've mentioned in the [previous article]({{<ref "posts/sdj_essay/index.md">}}). One very interesting outcome was that {{% game 376683 %}}In the Footsteps of Darwin{{% /game %}} was designed from the onset very intentionally with winning awards in mind. So far this plan seems to (almost) work out: The game got nominated for both [As d'Or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_d'Or) and {{% sdj / %}}, widely regarded as the most important awards in board gaming. It didn't win the former, but now has the chance to win the latter.


## {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}}

*2 players, 15 minutes, 12+ years, medium light (2.0)*

{{< img src="373106" size="x300" alt="Sky Team" >}}

*Pilot and co-pilot work together to land planes.*

{{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} is only the third two-player-game to be nominated for either {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} and {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} after {{% game 12002 %}}Jambo{{% /game %}} and {{% game 118048 %}}Targi{{% /game %}}. Of course, neither of them won, and I've already made the somewhat bold statement during the [nominations predictions]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2024/index.md">}}#2-a-hrefhttpsrecommendgamesgame373106-stylefont-variant-small-capssky-teama) that {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} "has next to no chance of winning". I'm not so sure of that anymore. For starters, there were similar sentiments that card games or co-ops wouldn't have a chance of winning {{% sdj / %}} ‚Äì until they did. Also, the jury stated that one can simply play this game in teams ‚Äì given that {{% game 318977 %}}MicroMacro{{% /game %}} and {{% game 370591 %}}Dorfromantik{{% /game %}} are essentially solo games that play well with a group, I'd say this logic checks out.

Of course, the strongest argument for {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} is its overwhelming reception, both within the geek community (it's en route of breaking into the BGG top 100) and the jury (just look at the phenominal average score of 8.8).

One last thought about it being nominated on the {{% sdj %}}red list{{% /sdj %}} even though most pundits had it under {{% kdj %}}anthracite{{% /kdj %}}. First off, it should prove that {{% sdj / %}} isn't nearly as shallow as the grognards want us to believe. Second, it shows that the question of {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} or {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} is much less about *complexity* and much more about *approachability*. The studio did a great job of providing a clear yet compelling first game experience, while literally hiding the extra material (and complexity) at first.


## Who will win?

It may be my ignorance, but {{% game 376683 %}}In the Footsteps of Darwin{{% /game %}} is for me the outsider amongst the nominees. I have a really hard time deciding between the other two games. {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} appears to be quite an exceptional game, but maybe the whole two-player-curse is still too much of a burden. In the end, my (proverbial) money is on {{% game 393325 %}}Captain Flip{{% /game %}} ‚Äì it'd be the winner most in keeping with the most recent choices.


# Nominated for {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2024{{% /kdj %}}

{{< img src="ksdj-2024" size="x300" alt="Kennerspiel des Jahres 2024" >}}

Let's take a look at the same metrics as above, but for the {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} nominees:

| Game | [Jury](reviews.csv) | [R.G](https://recommend.games/#/?for=S_d_J&yearMin=2024&yearMax=2023&include=350933,390092,334986&excludeRated=false) | Average | Bayes | [Poll](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3319930/poll-spiel-des-jahres-2024-and-kennerspiel-des-jah) |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}} | **8.3** (4) | 4.5 | 7.8 | 6.5 | **40.8%** |
| {{% game 350933 %}}The Guild of Merchant Explorers{{% /game %}} | 7.3 (3) | 6.9 | 7.7 | 7.0 | 24.8% |
| {{% game 390092 %}}Ticket to Ride Legacy{{% /game %}} | 8.0 (2) | **7.1** | **8.8** | **7.3** | 34.4% |

{{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}} hasn't been available in retail for very long (not at all yet in Europe outside Germany), which harms its rating related metrics. This way, {{% game 390092 %}}Ticket to Ride Legacy{{% /game %}} looks like the favourite by those numbers, but {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}} would be the frontrunner according to the jury and the poll. Again, let's take a look at the nominees in details to understand their chances of winning.


## {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}}

*1‚Äì4 players, 60‚Äì120 minutes, 10+ years, medium (3.0)*

{{< img src="334986" size="x300" alt="Daybreak" >}}

*Cooperatively decarbonize the planet and create resilient societies.*

I had the good fortune of trying out {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}} at SPIEL Essen last year. I'll admit, when I sat down at the table, I was overwhelmed by the flurry of icons. üòµ‚Äçüí´ But quickly, the gears all fit together and the beautiful thematic touches won over my heart before we'd finish the second round. This design is a masterpiece and the way it manages to make a statement without forgetting to be a fun game experience is quite outstanding.

This doesn't mean it's perfect ‚Äì game play can feel fairly solitaire and some thematic choices aren't to everybody's taste. Some called the game too easy, other too hard. Some find the heavy topic of the climate crisis disturbing their escapism, others find the game overly optimistic and relying too much on technical advances for its solutions. And pretty much every German seems to take offence with nuclear power being presented as a green source of energy. So should this game receive the award, I think it's safe to say it's going to generate some conversations, both in public and around the Christmas tree. In my opinion, this is the strongest argument for making {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}} the {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel 2024{{% /kdj %}}.


## {{% game 350933 %}}The Guild of Merchant Explorers{{% /game %}}

*1‚Äì4 players, 45 minutes, 14+ years, medium light (2.0)*

{{< img src="350933" size="x300" alt="The Guild of Merchant Explorers" >}}

*Explore strange lands, establish trade routes, and search for treasure.*

This game is so old, not only did I already predict it to be on the longlist [last year]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2023/index.md">}}#7-a-hrefhttpsrecommendgamesgame350933-stylefont-variant-small-capsthe-guild-of-merchant-explorersa), but [reportedly](https://bsky.app/profile/peersylvester.bsky.social/post/3kuntlbj3jy2t) even its German publisher had already marked it as "out of print". Now it's nominated for the biggest award in board gaming and can hope for many more print runs to come.

Despite its age, I still haven't played it, so I don't have much more to say about {{% game 350933 %}}The Guild of Merchant Explorers{{% /game %}}. My impression is that it was received very warmly and the nomination certainly wasn't a surprise (other than it not being clear what year it belongs to), but I haven't heard of much enthusiasm either, so a win would come unexpectedly.


## {{% game 390092 %}}Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West{{% /game %}}

*2‚Äì5 players, 20‚Äì90 minutes, 10+ years, medium (2.5)*

{{< img src="390092" size="x300" alt="Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West" >}}

*Build train lines across the United States in a twelve-game campaign.*

This game might be the first hobby board game I'd call a true blockbuster title: the biggest publisher in town hires some of the most famous designers to make one of the most popular titles even bigger. [Marvelisation]({{<ref "posts/gini/index.md">}}) in action. Of course, just as Marvel movies can be perfectly executed and highly entertaining cinema, {{% game 390092 %}}Ticket to Ride Legacy{{% /game %}} has received high praises for its game play experience.

This experience comes at a cost though. The game retails for 100 euros or more, which is an extremely steep ask for an award that otherwise emphasises approachability every chance they get. It would be very disappointing if the jury displayed this kind of blatant disregard of the economic reality of many of its target audience.

And then there's the issue of the game's narrative: Unlike in classic {{% game 9209 %}}Ticket to Ride{{% /game %}}, where you're simply riding the existing railroads, the legacy version is all about building and expanding westwards. For that, it heavily relies on the common tropes of the "Old West", which is often romanticised in American culture. The designers themselves acknowledge omitting its darker side in a pretty tired note at the end of the rulebook:

> Native American tribes were dispossessed and killed. Railroad laborers were exploited, mistreated, and injured. While designing this experience, we found no way to include these elements within the lighter theme of the game.

The German edition made it somehow even worse by translating "light" as "shallow". I don't say that every game needs to address every possible problematic aspect of its setting nor that the jury shouldn't have nominated {{% game 390092 %}}TtR Legacy{{% /game %}} because of it, but a note like this just seems like a poor excuse. Harald Schrapers, the jury chairman, wrote an essay in [Spielbox](https://spielbox.de/) 2024/2 expressing his disappointment about the thematic embedding ‚Äì and yet he still ranks {{% game 390092 %}}TtR Legacy{{% /game %}} amongst [his top games of 2024](https://gamesweplay.de/).


## Who will win?

I guess I made my position pretty clear: if the jury takes their own mission of promoting [*Kulturgut Spiel*]({{<ref "posts/sdj_essay/index.md">}}) seriously, they need to hand the award to {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}}, period. Even leaving the somewhat political considerations aside, there's too many aspects speaking *against* {{% game 390092 %}}Ticket to Ride Legacy{{% /game %}} and not enough *for* {{% game 350933 %}}The Guild of Merchant Explorers{{% /game %}}, so my clear favourite on all acounts is {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}}.

I feel I've leaned pretty far out of the window, especially given that I called this the closest race yet. üòÖ We shall see if my predictions come true on July 21 ‚Äì I'll be even more excited than usual!
