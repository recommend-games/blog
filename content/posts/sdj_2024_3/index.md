The waiting is finally coming to an end! On Sunday, July 21, the jury will announce the winners of {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres{{% /sdj %}} and {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2024{{% /kdj %}}. We're blessed with another year of very strong games and I'm certainly very excited to learn what games will win the two awards.

I've been doing this [for]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020_3/index.md">}}) [four]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2021_3/index.md">}}) [years]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2022_3/index.md">}}) [now]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2024_3/index.md">}}) and I've called seven out of the eight winners correctly. No reason to rest on any laurels ‚Äì there's another batch of awards coming up, and this year might be the closest race yet!


# Nominated for {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2024{{% /sdj %}}

Before we dive into the individual games, let's look at some numbers to see some objective measures for them ‚Äì as far as this is possible. What we've got at our disposal are the [jury's reviews](reviews.csv), [recommendations to the `S_d_J` bot](https://recommend.games/#/?for=S_d_J&yearMin=2024&yearMax=2023&include=376683,393325,373106,350933,390092,334986&excludeRated=false), BoardGameGeek's average rating and the [Bayesian rating]({{<ref "posts/reverse_engineer_bgg/index.md">}}). Additionally, I've created a [poll on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3319930/poll-spiel-des-jahres-2024-and-kennerspiel-des-jah) where the geeks could have their say:

| Game | [Jury](reviews.csv) | [R.G](https://recommend.games/#/?for=S_d_J&yearMin=2024&yearMax=2023&include=376683,393325,373106&excludeRated=false) | Average | Bayes | [Poll](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3319930/poll-spiel-des-jahres-2024-and-kennerspiel-des-jah) |

| {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} | **8.8** (4) | **7.0** | TODO | TODO | TODO |

TODO: What do the numbers say?


## {{% game 393325 %}}Captain Flip{{% /game %}}

*2‚Äì5 players, 20 minutes, 8+ years, light (1.1)*

{{< img src="393325" size="x300" alt="Captain Flip" >}}

*Hoist your flag, recruit a colorful crew, and earn as many gold coins as you can.*

The first release by [PlayPunk](https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2023/06/20/7-wonders-creator-repos-productions-co-founder-launch-new-publishing-company-playpunk/), co-founded by [hall of fame]({{<ref "posts/designer_hall_of_fame/index.md">}}) member [Antoine Bauza](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=9714), immediately landed them their first nomination. This game is doing to [Paolo Mori](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=7640)'s {{% game 125618 %}}Libertalia{{% /game %}} what {{% game 264055 %}}Draftosaurus{{% /game %}} did to {{% game 68448 %}}7 Wonders{{% /game %}}. That's a lot of {{% sdj / %}} cred in just two sentences.

On the surface, there isn't all that much to this game of flipping tiles and filling your ship with a colourful set of characters. It's quite random and solitaire ‚Äì yet this design somehow manages to pull the magic trick of keeping everyone around the table invested in every single draw and flip of a tile. It's fast, it's immediate, it's fun ‚Äì in other words: it's perfect {{% sdj / %}} material.


## {{% game 376683 %}}In the Footsteps of Darwin{{% /game %}}

*2‚Äì5 players, 20‚Äì30 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (1.6)*

{{< img src="376683" size="x300" alt="In the Footsteps of Darwin" >}}

*Assist Charles Darwin with his research for On the Origins of Species.*

I'll admit I have neither played nor heard all that much about this game until [Ben Maddox's interview](https://youtu.be/gLEq5l4RfWY?si=pHwe9qF5Hpg0eKda) which I've mentioned in the [previous article]({{<ref "posts/sdj_essay/index.md">}}). One very interesting outcome was that {{% game 376683 %}}In the Footsteps of Darwin{{% /game %}} was designed from the onset very intentionally with winning awards in mind. So far this plan seems to (almost) work out: The game got nominated for both [As d'Or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_d'Or) and {{% sdj / %}}, widely regarded as the most important awards in board gaming. It didn't win the former, but now has the chance to win the latter.


## {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}}

*2 players, 15 minutes, 12+ years, medium light (2.0)*

{{< img src="373106" size="x300" alt="Sky Team" >}}

*Pilot and co-pilot work together to land planes.*

{{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} is only the third two-player-game to be nominated for either {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} and {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} after {{% game 12002 %}}Jambo{{% /game %}} and {{% game 118048 %}}Targi{{% /game %}}. Of course, neither of them won, and I've already made during the [nominations predictions]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2024/index.md">}}#2-a-hrefhttpsrecommendgamesgame373106-stylefont-variant-small-capssky-teama) the somewhat bold statement that {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} "has next to no chance of winning". I'm not so sure of that anymore. For starters, there were similar sentiments that card games or co-ops wouldn't have a chance of winning {{% sdj / %}} ‚Äì until they did. Also, the jury stated that one can simply play this game in teams ‚Äì given that {{% game 318977 %}}MicroMacro{{% /game %}} and {{% game 370591 %}}Dorfromantik{{% /game %}} are essentially solo games that play well with a group, I'd say this logic checks out.

Of course, the strongest argument for {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} is its overwhelming reception, both within the geek community (it's en route of breaking into the BGG top 100) and the jury (just look at the phenominal average score of 8.8).

One last thought about it being nominated on the {{% sdj %}}red list{{% /sdj %}} even though most pundits had it under {{% kdj %}}anthracite{{% /kdj %}}. First off, it should prove that {{% sdj / %}} isn't nearly as shallow as the grognards want us to believe. Second, it shows that the question of {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}} or {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} is much less about *complexity* and much more about *approachability*. The studio did a great job of providing a clear yet compelling first game experience, while literally hiding the extra material (and complexity) at first.


## Who will win?

It may be my ignorance, but {{% game 376683 %}}In the Footsteps of Darwin{{% /game %}} is for me the outsider amongst the nominees. I have a really hard time deciding between the other two games. {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} appears to be quite an exceptional game, but maybe the whole two-player-curse is still a bit of a burden. In the end, my (proverbial) money is on {{% game 393325 %}}Captain Flip{{% /game %}} ‚Äì it'd be the winner most in keeping with the most recent choices.


# Nominated for {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2024{{% /kdj %}}

{{< img src="ksdj-2024" size="x300" alt="Kennerspiel des Jahres 2024" >}}

Let's take a look at the same metrics as above, but for the {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}} nominees:

| Game | [Jury](reviews.csv) | [R.G](https://recommend.games/#/?for=S_d_J&yearMin=2024&yearMax=2023&include=350933,390092,334986&excludeRated=false) | Average | Bayes | [Poll](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3319930/poll-spiel-des-jahres-2024-and-kennerspiel-des-jah) |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}} | **8.3** (4) | 4.5 | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| {{% game 350933 %}}The Guild of Merchant Explorers{{% /game %}} | 7.3 (3) | 6.9 | TODO | TODO | TODO |
| {{% game 390092 %}}Ticket to Ride Legacy{{% /game %}} | 8.0 (2) | **7.1** | TODO | TODO | TODO |

TODO: Interpret numbers


## {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}}

*1‚Äì4 players, 60‚Äì120 minutes, 10+ years, medium (3.0)*

{{< img src="334986" size="x300" alt="Daybreak" >}}

*Cooperatively decarbonize the planet and create resilient societies.*

I had the good fortune of trying out {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}} at SPIEL Essen last year. I'll admit, when I sat down at the table, I was overwhelmed by the flurry of icons. üòµ‚Äçüí´ But quickly, the gears all fit together and the beautiful thematic touches won over my heart before we'd finish the second round. This design is a masterpiece and the way it manages to make a statement without forgetting to be a fun game experience is quite outstanding.

This doesn't mean it's perfect ‚Äì game play can feel fairly solitaire and some thematic choices aren't too everybody's taste. Some called the game too easy, other too hard. Some find the heavy topic of the climate crisis disturbing their escapism, others find the game overly optimistic and relying too much on technical advances for its solutions. And pretty much every German seems to take offence with nuclear power being presented as a green source of energy. So should this game receive the award, I think is safe to say it's going to generate some conversations, both in public and around the Christmas tree. In my opinion, this is the strongest argument for making {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}} the {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel 2024{{% /kdj %}}.


## {{% game 350933 %}}The Guild of Merchant Explorers{{% /game %}}

*1‚Äì4 players, 45 minutes, 14+ years, medium light (2.0)*

{{< img src="350933" size="x300" alt="The Guild of Merchant Explorers" >}}

*Explore strange lands, establish trade routes, and search for treasure.*


## {{% game 390092 %}}Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West{{% /game %}}

*2‚Äì5 players, 20‚Äì90 minutes, 10+ years, medium (2.5)*

{{< img src="390092" size="x300" alt="Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West" >}}

*Build train lines across the United States in a twelve-game campaign.*
