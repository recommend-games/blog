{{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2024{{% /sdj %}} is around the corner! As in [the]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2020/index.md">}}) [previous]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2021/index.md">}}) [four]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2022/index.md">}}) [years]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2023/index.md">}}), I'll try to predict what games have the best shot at ending up on the longlist (aka *recommendations*) and the shortlist (aka *nominations*) when the jury announces their picks on June 11th.

As every year, I'll let the algorithms speak, but I've added something new this year: I tried to track the jury members' reviews of all eligible[^eligible] games, in particular when they publish scores (such as in the magazine Spielbox), and fed those into the predictions. The other major contributor are the ["recommendendations to the jury"](https://recommend.games/#/?for=S_d_J&excludeRated=false&yearMin=2023&yearMax=2024). Our very own [Kennerspiel score]({{<ref "posts/kennerspiel/index.md">}}) is then used to sort those into their respective list of the top 10 contenders for either award. You can find the [detailed analysis here](04_predictions.py) and [complete results here](predictions.csv).

This is quite a curious year. Usually, I've had quite clear favourites for the nominations or even the winners, but would find lots of surprises on the longlist. This year, however, there's been a large number of games with a really warm reception by the jury, which I believe we will see on the longlist, but not really any game that stands out as a clear favourite for the nominations.

The jury chairman, Harald Schrapers, already spoke some time ago of the [year of the card games](https://brett-spiel.de/2023/uno-mau-mau-derivate-ftw-vs-passt-nicht/), so prepare for lots of small but original card games in the predictions, which might be one reason why there's no clear favourite.

But without further ado, here are the favourite games to win {{% sdj / %}} and {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2024{{% /kdj %}}.


# Candidates for {{% sdj %}}Spiel des Jahres 2024{{% /sdj %}}

{{< img src="sdj-2024" size="x300" alt="Spiel des Jahres 2024" >}}


## #1: {{% game 396542 %}}The Same Game{{% /game %}}

*3–6 players, 30–45 minutes, 10+ years, light (1.0), 100% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="396542" size="x300" alt="The Same Game" >}}

*Discuss how completely different objects might share something in common.*

A cooperative party game by [Wolfgang Warsch](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=80162) – {{% game 396542 %}}The Same Game{{% /game %}} is a game to watch!


## #2: {{% game 390094 %}}FTW?!{{% /game %}}

*2–6 players, 25–40 minutes, 8+ years, 90% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="390094" size="x300" alt="FTW?!" >}}

*Play your cards cleverly to be the 1337 in FTW?!*

{{% game 390094 %}}FTW?!{{% /game %}}, an {{% game 2223 %}}UNO{{% /game %}} variant, could be [Friedemann Friese](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=141)'s first nomination in over a decade.


## #3: {{% game 400205 %}}5 Towers{{% /game %}}

*2–5 players, 15–30 minutes, 7+ years, 79% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="400205" size="x300" alt="5 Towers" >}}

*Get the most cards and build fantastic towers!*

[Kasper Lapp](https://recommend.games/#/?designer=95143) strikes again with {{% game 400205 %}}5 Towers{{% /game %}}!


## #4: {{% game 392023 %}}Mycelia{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 45 minutes, 9+ years, medium light (2.0), 62% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="392023" size="x300" alt="Mycelia" >}}

*Attract help from forest dwellers to remove dewdrops from your field.*

One of two games called {{% game 392023 %}}Mycelia{{% /game %}} from last year – what a sign if there ever was one that we've had enough nature kitsch!


## #5: {{% game 383458 %}}Sides{{% /game %}}

*2–9 players, 30–60 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.0), 74% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="383458" size="x300" alt="Sides" >}}

*Team members work together to have two of them guessing hidden word.*

{{% game 383458 %}}Sides{{% /game %}} looks a bit like a game generated by an AI that was trained on previous {{% sdj / %}} winners. Make of that what you will.


## #6: {{% game 353288 %}}Trekking Through History{{% /game %}}

*2–4 players, 30–60 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (1.8), 93% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="353288" size="x300" alt="Trekking Through History" >}}

*Time travel to some of the greatest moments in human history.*

{{% game 353288 %}}Trekking Through History{{% /game %}} used to have a beautiful cover. What has happened to it?


## #7: {{% game 311930 %}}Block and Key{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 20–40 minutes, 8+ years, medium light (1.7), 97% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="311930" size="x300" alt="Block and Key" >}}

*Cleverly place 3D blocks in a shared space to unlock the key to victory points.*


## #8: {{% game 352515 %}}Trio{{% /game %}}

*3–5 players, 15 minutes, 6+ years, light (1.0), 99% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="352515" size="x300" alt="Trio" >}}

*Reveal anyone's lowest or highest card and keep going until there're three of a kind!*

{{% game 352515 %}}Trio{{% /game %}} has won this year's As d'Or, France's answer to the {{% sdj / %}}, so is definitely one to consider.


## #9: {{% game 330592 %}}Phantom Ink{{% /game %}}

*4–8 players, 10–15 minutes, 13+ years, light (1.1), 99% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="330592" size="x300" alt="Phantom Ink" >}}

*Spirits race to get their medium teammates to guess a secret object.*

{{% game 330592 %}}Phantom Ink{{% /game %}} is another word guessing party game, but one with a lot of atmosphere. Its chances might be drastically improved by its much better German title.


## #10: {{% game 381078 %}}Comet{{% /game %}}

*2–4 players, 45–75 minutes, 12+ years, medium light (2.0), 70% {{% sdj %}}Spiel{{% /sdj %}}*

{{< img src="381078" size="x300" alt="Comet" >}}

*Save extinct and endangered species from their deadly fate by the threatening comet!*


# Candidates for {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel des Jahres 2024{{% /kdj %}}

{{< img src="ksdj-2024" size="x300" alt="Kennerspiel des Jahres 2024" >}}


## #1: {{% game 390092 %}}Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West{{% /game %}}

*2–5 players, 20–90 minutes, 10+ years, medium (2.5), 94% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="390092" size="x300" alt="Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West" >}}

*Build train lines across the United States in a twelve-game campaign.*

The jury states that they won't consider straight reimplementations of previous games, but they did nominate three different {{% game 30549 %}}Pandemic{{% /game %}} variants over the year. {{% game 390092 %}}Ticket to Ride Legacy: Legends of the West{{% /game %}} could definitely find a place on the longlist.


## #2: {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}}

*2 players, 15 minutes, 12+ years, medium light (2.0), 66% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="373106" size="x300" alt="Sky Team" >}}

*Pilot and co-pilot work together to land planes.*

The last 2-player game to be nominated for {{% kdj / %}} was {{% game 118048 %}}Targi{{% /game %}} in 2012. {{% game 373106 %}}Sky Team{{% /game %}} is highly praised, but has next to no chance of winning.


## #3: {{% game 231733 %}}Obsession{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 30–90 minutes, 14+ years, medium (3.1), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="231733" size="x300" alt="Obsession" >}}

*Renovate an estate, manage servants, and pursue romance in Victorian England.*

{{% game 231733 %}}Obsession{{% /game %}} was first released in 2018 and has gathered quite the following over the years, sitting at #62 on BGG.


## #4: {{% game 391163 %}}Forest Shuffle{{% /game %}}

*2–5 players, 40–60 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 94% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="391163" size="x300" alt="Forest Shuffle" >}}

*Gather the most valuable trees and attract species to them.*

{{% game 391163 %}}Forest Shuffle{{% /game %}} is high up on most pundits' lists. I'd say the theme is super bland, but at least in German its title is a pretty good pun.


## #5: {{% game 328565 %}}Caper: Europe{{% /game %}}

*2 players, 25–35 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.1), 77% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="328565" size="x300" alt="Caper: Europe" >}}

*Three heists. Two rivals. One criminal mastermind will rise to the top.*


## #6: {{% game 366013 %}}Heat: Pedal to the Metal{{% /game %}}

*1–6 players, 30–60 minutes, 10+ years, medium light (2.2), 66% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="366013" size="x300" alt="Heat: Pedal to the Metal" >}}

*Manage your race car's speed to keep from overheating.*

{{% game 366013 %}}Heat{{% /game %}} has been in the BGG hotness pretty much non-stop since its release and has climbed to #42. The jury however has not been as hot on it (pun intended) as the community.


## #7: {{% game 350933 %}}The Guild of Merchant Explorers{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 45 minutes, 14+ years, medium light (2.0), 95% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="350933" size="x300" alt="The Guild of Merchant Explorers" >}}

*Explore strange lands, establish trade routes, and search for treasure.*

{{% game 350933 %}}The Guild of Merchant Explorers{{% /game %}} was actually also #7 on [last year's predictions]({{<ref "posts/sdj_2023/index.md">}}#7-a-hrefhttpsrecommendgamesgame350933-stylefont-variant-small-capsthe-guild-of-merchant-explorersa), but apparently the jury only considers it for this year. Sometimes that's the hardest part of the predictions. 🤷


## #8: {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 60–120 minutes, 10+ years, medium (3.0), 99% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="334986" size="x300" alt="Daybreak" >}}

*Cooperatively decarbonize the planet and create resilient societies.*

What a topical game between all those anthropomorphic animals! {{% game 334986 %}}Daybreak{{% /game %}} combines a bold theme with interesting gameplay – and again has a much better title in German.


## #9: {{% game 321608 %}}Hegemony: Lead Your Class to Victory{{% /game %}}

*2–4 players, 90–180 minutes, 14+ years, medium heavy (4.2), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="321608" size="x300" alt="Hegemony: Lead Your Class to Victory" >}}

*Simulate a whole contemporary nation in this asymmetric, politico-economic euro-game.*

At least for me, {{% game 321608 %}}Hegemony{{% /game %}} shot out of nowhere into the BGG top 100. Quite heavy overall, but a place on the longlist is always possible.


## #10: {{% game 322289 %}}Darwin's Journey{{% /game %}}

*1–4 players, 60–120 minutes, 14+ years, medium heavy (3.9), 100% {{% kdj %}}Kennerspiel{{% /kdj %}}*

{{< img src="322289" size="x300" alt="Darwin's Journey" >}}

*Retrace Darwin’s journey to the Galapagos in a worker-placement adventure.*

[^eligible]: As every year, it's not straightforward to determine what games are eligible for the awards. Generally speaking, it'd be those games release between April 2023 and March 2024 into German retail. Hence, filtering by BGG release year will exclude games that were released earlier elsewhere, but only recently in Germany, and likewise let some games pass that have not seen a German release in that time window. I did my best to catch what I could, but there's always some that get away.
